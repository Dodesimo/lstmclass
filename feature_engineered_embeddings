"The Automobile Industry has done nothing but grow since World War II. The Car has begun to implement itself into our culture, becoming a part of sporting events, TV shows, and even video games. Recently, however, the automobile industry has been experiencing a shift in interest. Countries around the world are implementing ""Car Free Days,"" or even carfree cities into their laws and cultures. The new laws and ideas are seen by some as irrelevant, or pointless, and some have even resisted these laws. While car lovers and enthusiasts may not enjoy the laws very much, when implemented on their daily lives, studies have shown that the new ideas are extremely important, maybe even revolutionary.

The car free environment begins in the German suburbia, where residents of a large community called Vauban live their daily lives CarFree. Vauban is free of street parking and driveways, and full of cyclists, skateboarders, roller blades, and any other emmision free means of transportation you can imagine. Because of this, nearly 3 out of 4 families in Vauban do not own cars. ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, mother of 2 and resident of Vauban, Germany, mentioned in source 1. Car owners in Vauban park the vehicles in garages at the edge of town, to make commutes to nearby developments. Car free cities like Vauban are believed to be the next step to a greener, better world.

More efforts like Vauban are being made in large cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia. According to source 2, Paris recently enforced a law to reduce emmisions, where even number plated cars may drive on Monday, and odd number plated cars my drive on Tuesday, and so on. The laws soon proved ineffective after a short time, for Paris to recind them. Paris, being one of the most polluted European cities, will certainly be making more efforts against pollution. An improvement campaign in Bogota, Columbia calls for one whole day without cars, according to source 3. Citizens are urged to take other means of transportation, like bikes or busses. Violators faced a 25 fine. The dark gray rainclouds didn't stop the citizens of Bogota from taking away stress and air pollution. This year, for the first time, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined Bogota in the event. Cities around the world like Paris and Bogota are making efforts to reduce air pollution and leading better lives in cleaner cities.

Driving in America hit it's peak in 2005, when the number of miles driven in relationship to population was largest, according to source 4. Since then, the stats have dropped steadily, now sitting 9% below what it was in 1995. Many sociologists believe that the biggest decrease in milage is shown in young people between 16 and 39. Studies show that driving by these people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Many experts now believe that America's car culture has hit its peak, and is now on the decline.

There are many advantages of limiting car usage. The people of Bogota, Vauban, and Paris know that in most cases, cars cause stress, and that even a day without it can refresh your mind. The citizens of Vauban, who do not use cars in their daily lives, are living comfortably, and happily, without producing carbon emmisions into the environment. Even Americans are jumping on the band wagon, where young people are now using cars only when public transport is unavailable. Cars make moving easy, there is no doubt in that. But can the emmisions of the vehicles be avoided, without sacrificing the quality of our daily life? According to Vauban, Bogota, and Paris, it can be done, and it will be done.",0,"tensor([[-0.3526, -0.5830,  0.1561,  ..., -0.3370,  0.6153, -0.1322],

"When you see this face like formation what do you think? Aliens, rocks, sand? Well if you thought any of those it would be rocks and sand. Some people actually beleived this was made by extra terrestrials on Mars but no it's not This is just a rock formation found by NASA who thought at first it might have been an extra terrestrail creation.

This is not an alien creation if it were there would be arms, legs, or maybe a body poking out of the sand and rocks. But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out. If this was created by aliens they should still be on Mars or at least signs of them should still be there.

The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life. We found water on Mars so something had to have inhabitted Mars atr least once. Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space. But the face that they found on Mars was just a mesa, but who knows this could be some crazy alien statue buried underground we won't know for a while though.",0,"tensor([[-0.1972, -0.0786,  0.2429,  ..., -0.3757,  0.8607,  0.1257],

"Mental health is a growing concern in our society today, and it's important to understand the causes of mental illness. Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness – affecting an estimated 17.3 million adults in America alone. It can manifest itself through feelings of sadness, anxiety, irritability, and fatigue that last for weeks or even months at a time; and it can be triggered by numerous events such as major life changes or trauma. Though genetics may play a role in predisposing someone to depression, there are also several environmental factors that contribute to its onset as well. For example, research suggests that living with chronic stress places individuals at higher risk for developing depression – often due to increased levels of cortisol which can damage areas within the brain known to regulate emotion and mood control. This kind of stress could come from social situations like family conflict or bullying; work-related issues associated with long hours or job insecurity; economic struggles like poverty or debt; physical health concerns such as chronic pain or disability; traumatic experiences such as abuse or loss; and cognitive problems like rumination on negative thoughts or self-criticism all increase vulnerability towards depressive episodes over time. Awareness about mental health conditions is increasing every day but this does not mean everyone affected receives adequate treatment for their condition when needed. Mental disorders should be addressed just like any other medical issue: with appropriate diagnosis from a qualified healthcare professional followed by evidence-based treatments including psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy being particularly beneficial), medications if necessary (antidepressants being the most commonly prescribed), lifestyle adjustments (healthy diet/exercise routine) along with possible support groups/additional resources depending on individual need—all working together towards improved psychological functioning overall. The goal should always be creating healthier coping strategies so those struggling with mental illnesses feel empowered enough take back control over their lives instead of relying solely on external sources for help – thus allowing them full access to reach their highest potential

"There are those who believe that to be successful, one must only do things that they are already good at. Others believe that success comes from taking risks and trying new things. I believe that the latter is more accurate. Success does not come from complacency, but from a willingness to take risks.

In order to achieve success, one must be willing to try new things and take risks. This does not mean that one should abandon all caution and jump into every new opportunity head-first. But it does mean that one should be willing to step out of their comfort zone and take calculated risks.

Those who only do things they are already good at are limiting themselves. They may achieve a certain level of success, but it will likely be lower than what they could have achieved if they had been willing to take risks. Furthermore, they will likely become bored and stagnant in their career.

Taking risks can be scary, but it is also exhilarating. It is when we take risks that we truly test ourselves and see what we are capable of. It is also when we learn the most. When we only do things we are already good at, we never push ourselves to learn new things.

Of course, there is a balance to be struck. One should not take unnecessary risks that could lead to failure or harm. But if we always play it'safe, we will never achieve true success.

"Essay:

Limiting Car Usage: A Step Towards a Sustainable Future

In today's world, it is becoming increasingly important to find alternative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat the adverse effects of climate change. One such solution that is gaining traction is the limitation of car usage. This idea is not only being implemented in cities around the world but is also gaining the support of citizens who are realizing the numerous advantages of living without cars.

One prime example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Residents of this experimental district have made the conscious decision to give up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, with the exception of the main thoroughfare for public transportation. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into this eco-friendly neighborhood (Rosenthal). The residents of Vauban have reported a higher level of happiness and a reduction in stress since giving up their cars. This highlights the psychological benefits of reducing car usage and relying on alternative forms of transportation.

The impact of car usage on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be understated. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some heavily car-dependent areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and move towards a more sustainable future. This shift is crucial in mitigating climate change and its devastating effects.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also improve the health of our cities. The smog problem faced by cities like Paris has forced them to enforce partial driving bans in order to clear the air. During these bans, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent and the city's smog levels were comparable to heavily polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer). These measures not only improve air quality but also make cities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and noise pollution.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also revitalize urban areas and create more accessible communities. Suburban development has traditionally been centered around cars, with wide roads and large parking areas. This model is slowly changing as cities adopt smart planning principles. Communities like Vauban are placing stores within walking distance of homes, making it easier for residents to get their daily needs without depending on cars. This kind of compact and accessible urban development can relieve pressure on city infrastructure and promote walkability (Rosenthal).

It is important to note that efforts to limit car usage are not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented a car-free day, where millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. As a result, the streets of Bogota are temporarily free of traffic jams, and alternative transportation methods are promoted (Selsky). This initiative demonstrates that limiting car usage is not only feasible but also scalable to other cities around the world.

While it is important to acknowledge the potential negative implications for the car industry, it is necessary to adapt to the changing cultural shift towards alternative forms of transportation. Car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as mobility companies, recognizing the need to diversify their offerings beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal). This shift in the market presents an opportunity for the development of innovative transportation solutions that meet the needs of a changing society.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that go beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It improves happiness and reduces stress for individuals, improves air quality and health in cities, revitalizes urban areas, and promotes accessibility and walkability. As more cities and communities around the world embrace this shift towards car-reduced living, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to support and implement initiatives that limit car usage. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1,"tensor([[-0.3122, -0.3730, -0.1117,  ..., -0.1894,  0.5505, -0.1966],

"Have you ever had a tough decision to make, or problem to solve, and had no idea what to do? In this position, people often seek advice from others. When asking for advice, someone should seek multiple opinions because people have different points of view, unique strengths and talents, and have been through different experiences.

Someone should ask more than one person when seeking for advice because everyone has different points of view. If someone asks more than one person, they will be provided with many different points of view. With many different points of view provided, they will be able to see how other's view the subject compared to how they view it. Additionally, if someone is provided with many points of view, then they can decide which point of view will help them best overcome this challenge or decision. If they hadn't talked to more than one person, they might not have found the best way to solve their problem. Lastly, confronting many people when in need of advice and hearing many different points of view will help them have a more open mind. With a more open mind to ideas and solutions, they will better be able to make the right decision or solve their problem the best way that they can. When in need of advice, it is good for someone to go to many people to be provided with several unique points of view because they will help them see what the better choice would be, but that is not the only good thing that can come from asking multiple people for advice.

Another good thing that comes from seeking advice from more than one person is that different people have different strengths and talents. One person may be good at comforting others. They will be able to help someone feel better about their problem or decision. Another person someone asks for help may be good at helping them brainstorm solutions. By helping them brainstorm solutions, they will be able to pick the best way to handle the situation. Another person may be good at seeing other people's views. They will be able to see the person's point of view and see how their decision will affect others. Seeking advice from several people will benefit them because everyone has different strengths and talents they can share, which will help someone make a better choice, and there is one more good thing that comes from asking for advice from more than one person.

Lastly, one more good thing that comes from seeking advice from multiple people instead of just one person can help someone because everyone has been through different experiences. Someone they ask for advice might have been through something quite similar. Having been through something similar, they can help someone make a good decision. Another person may have been through something much more difficult. They will be able to help the person with a problem see that their problem is not as bad as it could be, and that they will be able to get through it. Lastly, they might be able to learn something new. Since everyone has different experiences, someone will be able to learn something from other's experiences that might help them with their decision or problem. Seeking advice from many people will benefit someone by learning about other's experiences and helping them make the best decision.

When in need of advice, someone should always seek help from multiple people. Asking for advice from several people can help them make a better decision because everyone has different points of view, everyone has unique strengths and talents, and everyone has been through different experiences. Next time you're in need of advice, talk to more than one person!",0,"tensor([[ 0.0679, -0.4589, -0.6218,  ..., -0.2182,  0.0199,  0.4501],

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to urge you to reconsider our country's current use of the Electoral College system. After deep investigation and consideration, I have found that most voters, myself included, would instead prefer a direct election.

In our status quo, as established by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process comprises of elector selection, meetings, and vote counting by Congress. Each state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of its Congressional delegation members. However, this process has its flaws, as stated by Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" In his plight for a change to direct vote, he argues that the Electoral College system is both non-democratic and confusing, leading potentially to electoral ""disasters."" In fact, electors have historically flouted public opinion and voted according to their own whim, which undermines democratic principles.

Opponents of the direct vote system argue that the Electoral College offers ""certainty of outcome,"" encourages candidates to have a ""trans-regional appeal,"" and ensures that more ""thoughtful voters"" will decide elections, as Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out in his essay ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" While these are seemingly valuable benefits, they do not sufficiently counterbalance the principle of fairness that our democracy should uphold. More fundamentally, it does not sit well with a vast majority of people that someone can win the most popular votes and still lose the presidency. 

In addition, the Electoral College seems to exacerbate the gap between different states' political influence. As it stands, candidates tend to pay more attention to larger states and swing states, leaving lesser populous states feeling neglected, which contradicts the principle of equality that a democratic nation should cherish. Consequently, the system favors some voters over others, as Plumer explained. 

The arguments against the Electoral College system align more consistently with our democratic ideals than the arguments in favor of maintaining it. As the matters stand, the Electoral College system feels outdated and disjointed from the transformation our society has experienced since it was established. 

I appeal to you to advocate on our behalf to maintain our country's integrity by replacing this flawed system with a direct voting system, which would foster a more accurate representation of our citizenry in the election of our President.

Yours sincerely,
[Your name]",1,"tensor([[-0.2449, -0.0011, -0.7999,  ..., -0.1956,  0.5418,  0.5957],

"Dear, Principal

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student of SCHOOL_NAME. I believe that Policy 1 is a good idea for the school. That students can be allowed to use there cell phone during lunch time or when we have free time. And that we aren't allowed to use them in class. If you don't allow cell phone's at school all of the student's will not be in the same side as you.

One of the reason's that you should allow phone's at school, is cause student's would not be in the same side as you. and they would still bring their cell phone's. When that happens student's will be in the office all the time.

That's why you should allow cell phone's.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2984, -0.1619,  0.1088,  ..., -0.2156,  0.5016,  0.7129],

"Phones and Driving

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over the past two decades phones and technology have expanded and so have the dangers of getting behind the wheel with a cellular device. I believe that no one has a reason to be doing anything other than driving when in a vehicle. Cellular devices have become a major issue whether you're a senior citizen or a beginner at driving.

Over the past few years that technology has expanded into many forms more and more casualties have occurred on the roads. The United States Department of Transportation reported that cell phones are involved in about 1.6 million auto crashes each year meaning that these 1.6 million car crashes involved cellular devices being a distraction to drivers. Some of the cell phone related car crashes lead to deaths of the distracted drivers and even the people who weren't even behind the wheel. There are many different ways to be distracted by a cellular device. This includes texting, maps, email, and social media.

Emotions over text messages could also effect a driver's state of mind while driving. If a driver were to get mad or upset over something they saw or read they could get distracted and lose control of the vehicle. Also could affect others that are driving. Other drivers could be in danger if someone can't see because they are distracted texting someone back. Overall this means that emotions could overcome someone if they used a cellular device while driving.

The law in Georgia is called the hands free law in my own words I think of this as both hands on the wheel. This is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel. Using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency. If an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because of the panic and only one hand to steer. I think that both hands is an important safety when it comes to driving.

These three major points support my reason as to why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices behind the wheel. Emotion effecting the capability of someone driving, casualties because of distractions caused by cellular devices and, two free hands that will make the possibilities of crashing slim to none.",0,"tensor([[-0.4361, -0.0925, -0.4195,  ..., -0.2345,  0.0799,  0.1303],

"Famous people are often in the public eye, and their every move is scrutinized by the media. Some people believe that this is unfair and that celebrities should be given more privacy, while others argue that this is the price of their fame. In my opinion, I believe that famous people should be given some degree of privacy, but they should also expect to be in the public eye.

On the one hand, it is understandable that famous people would want some privacy. They are human beings, after all, and they deserve to have some time to themselves without being hounded by the paparazzi. Moreover, some celebrities have reported feeling anxious and depressed due to the constant attention they receive from the media. For example, Princess Diana was famously hounded by the press, and this contributed to her tragic death in 1997.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that fame comes with certain responsibilities. Celebrities are often role models for young people, and they have a duty to behave in a responsible and ethical manner. Moreover, many celebrities have built their careers on their public image, and they rely on the media to maintain their popularity. For example, Kim Kardashian has built a multimillion-dollar empire by sharing her life with the public through social media and reality TV.

In conclusion, I believe that famous people should be given some degree of privacy, but they should also expect to be in the public eye. The media has a responsibility to report on celebrities in a responsible and ethical manner, and celebrities have a responsibility to behave in a way that is consistent with their public image. Ultimately, it is up to each individual celebrity to decide how much of their private life they want to share with the public.

"Maintaining the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for presidential elections. The Electoral College, established as a compromise by the founding fathers in the Constitution, ensures a fair and balanced representation of voters across the United States, and it remains essential to preserving our democratic system. While some argue in favor of a direct election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is an integral part of our electoral process, providing several advantages that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees the certainty of the election outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's passage, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This mitigates the risk of prolonged disputes and ensures a smooth transfer of power. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to contested and disputed results, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election, which further highlights the need to maintain the stability provided by the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation and not just a single region. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his defense of the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This requirement forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal and incentivizes them to campaign in diverse parts of the country, making them accountable to the interests and concerns of a wide range of states and demographics. This fosters a more inclusive and representative democracy, benefiting both populous states and smaller states alike.

Thirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. As Judge Posner argued, the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes prompts candidates to target swing states, where voters play a crucial role in deciding the outcome. This ensures that candidates engage with the concerns and priorities of these states, leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate. Additionally, by focusing on swing states, candidates are motivated to appeal to moderate voters since swing states tend to be politically diverse. This, in turn, encourages political moderation and compromise, which is key to a functional democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a political balance for large states. Due to the apportionment of the Senate, large states already have less representation in Congress per capita than small states. The Electoral College restores some of this balance by providing more attention to large states during campaigns. By allocating more electoral votes to states with larger populations, the Electoral College ensures that candidates dedicate resources and engage with the concerns of these significant constituencies.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. As Judge Posner noted, the system avoids scenarios in which no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast, thereby producing a clear and decisive winner. This eliminates the complexities and costs associated with run-off elections, offering a practical solution to potential electoral deadlock.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College suppresses the influence of voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, I believe the widespread participation in elections demonstrates that American citizens value expressing their political preferences. Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to create broad-based national campaigns, ensuring that even states often seen as ""safe"" for one party still receive attention and consideration.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a pivotal role in our democratic processes and should be maintained for presidential elections. It provides certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, emphasizes swing states, balances political influence between large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements to the system can be considered, such as addressing state laws on elector selection, the core principles of the Electoral College remain crucial to preserving our democratic values and ensuring a fair representation of voters across the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College system and to support its continued implementation for presidential elections. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.7060, -0.1838, -0.6978,  ..., -0.1066,  0.2388,  0.6445],

"Dear Florida Senator, I am here to tell you about thee electoral collage, and not why we should keep thee horrible theing, but how we can replace it withe sometheing better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since thee Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated and changed to benefit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become anotheer reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about thee Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all theese processes. We do not want hoops theat we want to jump therough. We are simple people who want a simple process. In thee electoral collage, theere are 538 electors, withe a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of thee House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used thee poular voting system. In theis system, thee people can directly vote for theier president witheout any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for thee voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair thee Electoral Collage is.

In thee Electoral Collage, theere is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, withe thee exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to theis idea. Swing states are very large states theat have a higher representation in thee Electoral collage. These are also thee main targets of presidential candidates. By getting theese swing states, candidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves otheer states, such as Ohio and Montana withe little to no interaction from thee presidential candidates. This is not fair. We need thee popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone witheout any shady practices. And theat is thee last topic, thee electors really control thee final outcome.

The final sin of thee electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wetheer a person is voted in or not because of thee electors. They choose who theey represent. If you can not see where theis is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state withe only representatives of one candidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who theey want to vote for. Notheing more, notheing less.

Even theough thee Electoral Collage seems like the root of all evil, theere are a few upsides. First, theere is less likely to have a dispute thean a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how theey should be. They are larger states theat comprise most of thee population and thee country. They should be represented more thean smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, theere are no RunOff elections. This keeps thee process shorter, but not as short as it would be in thee popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific candidate. Altheough thee electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids RunOff elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift thee election from one side to anotheer. Popular vote keeps thee process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree withe me, I want you to look and thee cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in thee Election from now on.",0,"tensor([[-0.4031, -0.0463,  0.2685,  ..., -0.3301,  0.6812,  0.8742],

"In Vauban, Germany, the citizens are not allowed to own cars and if they do, they're parked on outskirts of the city or in garages at the end of their developments. The citizens walk and bike ride places, and they refrain from using their vehicle as much as possible. Overall, people are happier. They're getting more exercise and are being able to enjoy the outdoors and communicate with eachother more than if you were passing your neighbor in your car. It leaves the streets safer for the children and creates a more family-centered environment that the rest of Europe is starting to experiment.

Maybe your idea of a family centered area is one of spread out houses with private garages and cars but we can also create that by doing away with vehicles and removing them from our environment.

In Paris, vehicles were banned for a period of time because the of smog content in the city. If citizens did not comply to this order they were to be fined and your vehicle could be impounded. The increase use of motorized vehicles by mass pollutes cities and makes it unsafe to breath the air. Hybrids, plug in cars, and vehicles transporting 3 or more people were excused from this sudden crack-down on automobile use, but after a few days the French government allowed it to return to the normal use of all vehicles.

In Bogota, Columbia, no-car days are being experimented with. The citizens have been every enthusiatic in participating and overall it has been a huge opportunity for people to get out and enjoy the city on foot, on bikes, or in buses or taxis. Other cities surrounding Bogota joined in the event this year and also enforced fines upon anyone who did not comply to the rule.

"I am a scientist at NASA. I am argueing with someone who thinks that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I will provide simple facts that everyone will be able to understand and hopefully help you see that the face on Mars is nothing but a landfom created by natural causes.

When the first picyure of the ""Face"" came out on the Viking 1, the small indents and the shadow angle showed what looked like a human face but was actually just one of the many mounds that for there. The United Staes actually has mounds of lava that had formed NATURALY in Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Many people believe that if it is used for advortizement that is is a real true fact and they can believe that what ever is on that buildboard or sign on the highway that has had or is going to happen. The Face of Mars has been used for marketing for over 25 years so it would sell more item to the population and the buisness CEO's would make more money.

People also believe in one picture on a cloudy day that they could see markings on the mound that would show that Martians have been and built the Face, but on a cloudlaess summer day in 2001 we captured a picture of the mound with our new and improved cameras that spans 1.5 meters compared to the 43 meter camera that the Viking used. The newer camera can discren things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,so we could see if there was anything on the mound that would show living things on the planet Mars",0,"tensor([[-0.4718, -0.1527,  0.5262,  ..., -0.2313,  0.7098,  0.3750],

"One uses a car to go to thee store, pick someone up, or even to go shopping, but what if people had no cars? Not having a car would have advantages.

To start withe, not having a car helps thee environment.

Our air will get better if we start not having cars.

Also, anotheer advantage is theat people will get healtheier. No polution gives people healtheier air and withe no cars people will have to walk everywhere or bike. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents withein a rectangular square mile, may be thee most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. But its basic precepts are bing adopted around thee world in attempts to make thee suburbs more compact and more accessible to thee public transportation, withe less space for parking. In theis new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, ratheer thean in malls along some distant highway."" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Witheout Cars, paragraph 6. Ones destination will be a walk away not miles. People will just walk, bike, and if theeir destination is far away one will take public transportation. One will become more active witheout cars.

Finally, driving is comming to an end. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb thee Untied States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest theat Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" The end of car culture, paragraph 29. Gas cost more, people are getting hurt while texting and driving, and some people just don't know how to drive. People seem to be getting over cars. This could help thee environment. Driving just isn't a priority.

In conclusion, having no more cars would benifit people. The environment will be better and people are getting over cars anyways. Why drive a car theat harms thee air, when one could simpily walk or ride a bike making one healtheier too?

"Few things are more captivating than the history of women's fashion in the 1920s. This period was an exciting and transformative time for clothing, as it marked a radical departure from the restrictions of Edwardian styles that had been popular prior to World War I. Women were granted unprecedented freedom to express themselves through their attire, experimenting with silhouettes, colors and fabrics unlike ever before. . The classic flapper dress is perhaps one of the most iconic garments associated with this decade. Characterized by its distinct dropped waist silhouette, loose fit and short length – often right below or above the knee – these dresses revolutionized fashion conventions at the time. Not only did they provide an opportunity for increased mobility and comfort while dancing but they also declared independence from outdated notions of femininity that suggested modesty over free expression. To complete this look, many women accessorized with pearls, headbands adorned with feathers or flowers and strings of beads draped around their necks like chokers; all symbols of liberation during a rapidly modernizing world order. . Although bias cut gowns made popular by designer Coco Chanel provided some alternative eveningwear options for those seeking something less revealing than a flapper dress - featuring long hemlines that hugged curves rather than skimmed them - there was still no shortage in color or sparkle among these designs either! Sequins, velvet trimming and beading were used liberally to create ensembles both glamorous yet dignified enough to suit any occasion on a woman's social calendar throughout the 20s era. These pieces effectively bridged traditionalism alongside contemporaneity in equal measure allowing wearers to remain loyal to age-old customs whilst simultaneously embracing new ideas about personal style too!. . Indeed when one considers how significantly trends have changed since then it can be said without doubt that women’s fashion during this decade truly set itself apart from anything else that came before it - paving way for greater creativity when exploring design elements such

"Have you ever wondered what the electoral college is? If you answered no I would say me to, but in this essay im going to explain why i am for it. I havent heard of the electoral college till now. So sit back and read this.

I think that we should do the electoral college, so everyone has a say on who they want to be the state senate. Under the college system,  voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. While others might say no we need to get rid of the electoral college, because the senate might be bribing the voters, so he knows that he/she has their vote for sure.

This is where it gets tricky. Alot of people might disagree with you because you have a different point of view than them, but it is ok if you disagree with them, because its your vote that counts. This might be what they say ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". The biggest arguments are, because people say that one of the runners in the campaign did something they wasn't suppose to do.

At the most basic level, The elctoral college is unfair to voters. That is probaly something you would say if you was against the electoral college. It's ok to go for what you believe in. You might get judged but who cares it's your opinion don't listen to them.

I personally think that we should keep it. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. it's nearly impossible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Believe it or not its has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that's the first time since 1988.

There is 5 reasons for retaining the electoral college despute its lack of democratic pedigree. It may have ripped some people off, but at least we got people as good presidents. You may not like them, but they have helped us over the years that we were in debt and need. Like right now the president's wife is helping the obese kids at school by putting in whole grains and healthier foods. Those are good reasons, but not as good as these.

Certainty of out come.

The reason is that winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds more than enough. Because almost all the states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis, even a vey slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible. But the stakes are highly unlikely to happen.

Everyone's President

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. There is region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president. some people has no incentive to campaign heavily in the states that they are regionally favorited, becuse they will not gain any electoral votes by increasing their plurality.

Swing States

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in the toss up states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. So they know that they are going to know that they are deciding the election. They are also likely to be the most thoughtful voters.

Big States

The elctoral college restores somke of the weight in the political balance that large sates lose by virtue of the mal-appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The most popular vote in 2012 was by the state of Florida. Obama won that election with only 29 electoral votes. Bigger states get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state does.

Avoid Run Off Elections

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which the candidate recieves a majority of the votes by the cast. When neither of the candidates recieve majority vote it becomes more intense, because they start trying their hardest so they can win the election. Well there is the five reasons.

It can be argued but only one will be victorious. Will we keep the electoral vote? Or will we get rid of it? So if i persuaded you to keep it pick, then keep if i didnt, then pick get rid of it. Which one will you choose.",0,"tensor([[-0.3591, -0.0768, -0.2485,  ..., -0.1905,  0.6245,  0.7510],

One famous quote by Michelangelo that relates to the challenge of setting goals in modern society is, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" This quote speaks to the difficulty of knowing our own limits when it comes to setting goals. It is often difficult to accurately gauge our own abilities and comparing them with the goals that we set for ourselves. If we set goals that are too difficult, we may become frustrated and unhappy with our position. But if we set goals that are too easy, we may become complacent and never strive for improvement. Setting both easy and hard goals can be beneficial, as it challenges us to continuously work towards personal growth and development. For example, if someone wished to become a professional musician, setting easier goals such as learning chords or chords progressions can provide the necessary foundation while still inspiring them to eventually reach their goal. Setting easy goals can create a scaffolding that will help to eventually create a larger structure. Thus, by setting both easy and hard goals and knowing our limits, we can consistently strive for greater heights.",1,"tensor([[-1.8884e-01,  6.5119e-02, -5.6171e-01,  ..., -1.9829e-01,

"There are many factors to consider when determining whether young people or older people enjoy life more. Age is just one aspect to consider; other factors such as health, wealth, social status, and relationship status can also play a role in how much someone enjoys life. In general, however, I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do.

One reason why young people may enjoy life more than older people is because they have more energy and vitality. They are able to stay up late, party, and travel more easily than older people. They also tend to be more physically active, which can lead to a sense of overall well-being. Additionally, young people are typically more optimistic than older people and have not yet experienced as many disappointments or setbacks in life.

Of course, there are also some downsides to being young. For example, young people may have more anxiety and insecurity than older people. They may also be more likely to experience peer pressure and make impulsive decisions. However, I believe that the upsides of being young outweigh the downsides.

In conclusion, I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do. This is due to a variety of factors, including more energy, vitality, and optimism. While there are some downsides to being young, I believe that the upsides outweigh the downsides.

"One of the most important aspects of a successful life is having an education. With this in mind, it can be beneficial to understand how pursuing higher education can benefit your career and personal growth. Obtaining a college degree or post-secondary training affords individuals with the opportunity to gain knowledge that will help them succeed in their chosen field. Through courses such as math, science, literature and more, students learn vital information that could give them a competitive edge in their future profession. For example, those seeking a career in engineering might need to take courses that focus on physics and mathematics; those looking for work in accounting may need classes on financial principles; while aspiring teachers should have coursework focused on educational methods and curriculum development. Higher education also provides invaluable skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and communication which are transferable across professions. In addition to gaining knowledge specific to one’s chosen field, these valuable tools empower people with the confidence they need when encountering day-to-day challenges at work or home. By understanding how each skill is applicable within different areas of their lives – from interacting with colleagues or customers effectively to managing budgets responsibly – students learn how apply what they've learned outside the classroom setting too. Lastly but equally significant is the professional network formed through attending school which can lead open pathways for long term career success. Being surrounded by classmates who share similar interests allows for conversations about potential job prospects or opportunities which otherwise would not be accessible if someone were solely relying on networking online or through family members alone . Being able to build relationships directly with potential employers helps set graduates apart from other candidates vying for positions due high caliber recommendations coming from trusted peers within academia circles. . Ultimately investing time into pursuing higher education comes down individual goals whether professional advancement , acquiring new skills sets ,or building lifelong connections . While there no guarantee success after completing degree program , developing capabilities necessary thrive today's increasingly complex society makes worthwhile investment anyone strives create brighter future themselves

Duke Ellington's famous quote ""A problem is a chance to do your best"" serves to remind people that stumbling blocks can often be opportunities to put our best efforts forward and rise to the occasion. I've applied this lesson in a variety of situations. 

In terms of sports, I’ve regularly faced physical setbacks due to a weak ankle. Despite being discouraged at first, I’ve taken Ellington’s advice to heart and worked extra hard on strengthening it to assure I don’t miss out on any opportunity to compete.

This quote has also inspired me to take a hands-on approach to tackling tough challenges in school. For instance, when I struggled to memorize a math formula, I chose to focus on what I needed to learn and spent additional time on drilling the material until I was confident I had mastered it. 

Also, issues between family members are difficult to resolve, but I’ve used this philosophy to work through our conflicts with kindness and understanding. For example, when there was a disagreement between my brother and I about how to split the chores, rather than arguing, I immediately looked for the most fitting solution that everyone could live with and that achieved the best outcome possible. 

By analyzing Duke Ellington's quote, it's evident that it instills a sense of positivity and strength even when obstacles arise. It reminds us to remain resilient and provides an opportunity to showcase our best abilities.",1,"tensor([[-0.4514, -0.1433, -0.7823,  ...,  0.2036, -0.0864,  0.1508],

"The Electoral College consists of more cons than pros. The systems that the unprogrammed engineers work on are complicated vast perspectives. When a president gets elected the most voters and does not receive presidency, wouldn't that confuse you. Popular voting is an effective way to give a candidate presidency simply because the people want that candidate to be the one responsible for the United States. The Electoral College needs to change the way it picks its president. Otherwise, the U.S. would be vulnerable to a president that most people completely denied for the other candidate.

The thing with popular voting is that people can get the president they want. When the elections are based on which candidate has the most popular votes, there are no crazy tricks or a hidden trump card. All you have is a candidate that deserves to be the president of the United States. A good example is Al Gore and his presidency crisis. Most voters looked up to him as president. It was only until the quirks of the electoral college stole his opportunity of becoming president thanks to the system of the electoral college we have today. The situation that makes this crisis even worse is how the voters for the actual electors themselves cannot control whether they win the election or lose. This means that if we keep the routine of the electoral college we have now, there are many opportunities for an unwanted elector. Therefore, leading to an unwanted president.

Ever since 2000, many people have been suffering from economics and industry. This is the simple result of a bad electoral college system. The people of course should have most of the perks in picking a president. If the president is bad at his job in making the U.S. habitable, then the electors are to blame for making a huge mistake. Many doors are opened to sudden changes and confusing decisions. John F. Kennedy could've lost his position since all of the votes didn't necessarily go to him. There's a valid reason why people vote for a candidate. To pick the president they know suits them best.

I will admit to this though. Popular voting is not the accurate way to go through with. I mean there are situations where people just pick a president because he looks professional. Others are simply racist and go for the white candidate or even viseversa. Popular voting is not perfect in the sense of the psychological opinions of the voters themselves. Besides, all of the people living in american soil are different minded. There is literally no way to immediately recognize who the voter is and why his reasons for voting are wrong. There is also nothing we can do since people are allowed to vote for whatever reasons they want.

Due to all of the information given to me about Al Gore and unwanted electors, it is the best solution to change the system to popular voting. Both sides of the arguments have strong reasons to either keep their system or change the way the electoral college is run. Meanwhile, lets be honest. There have been more political downfall with the system we have now that can be fixed with popular voting. Even though there are people that vote for selfish and unreliable reasons, there is still a balance of the people who want this president and the people who don't. The U.S. is consisted of minds that think completely different in the sense of human nature. We don't live in a utopia where everyone agrees with eachother.

"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" by James Trefil is an interesting article that discusses the difficulties and dangers involved in exploring Venus. Despite these challenges, the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea.

The author supports the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit by highlighting the importance of understanding this planet. Venus is a unique planet that shares many similarities with Earth, such as its size and composition. By studying Venus, we can gain valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.

Additionally, the author emphasizes that exploring Venus is not just about gaining scientific knowledge. It is also about pushing the limits of human exploration and pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve as a species. This is a powerful argument that speaks to the human spirit of exploration and discovery.

However, the author could have done a better job of addressing the potential risks and consequences of exploring Venus. While the article touches on some of the challenges involved, it does not explore the risks in sufficient detail. For example, the author does not discuss the potential impact of a failed mission or the risks associated with exposing humans to the harsh conditions of Venus.

In conclusion, James Trefil makes a compelling argument for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author could have done a better job of addressing the potential risks and consequences of exploring Venus, the overall argument is well supported by the evidence presented in the article. Ultimately, the decision to explore Venus will depend on a complex set of factors, including the risks involved, the potential benefits, and the available resources.",1,"tensor([[-0.9152, -0.4171, -0.7699,  ..., -0.0574,  0.8039,  0.2466],

"Phones and driving

Usi5ng your phone while driving is very dangerous because a lot of people die because of texting and driving. Especially a lot of teenagers who drive use social media while they're driving.

Which is one of the main cause for so many deaths not only in teens but in adults.

As social media continues to progress and now that everything is on the Internet texting and driving isn't the main issue. The main issue is that there is nothing that is stopping people from being on their phones in general. Phones in general are a big distraction and especially while driving. People will tend to look at emails, check social media, or just simply send a text message while they are at stop sign but that can be just as dangerous as well because as the driver hits the gas they are looking at their phones at the same time and then boom that's wen the big accident happens. This is a very common thing that happens with a lot of people who aren't careful enough to put their phones down and pay attention to the road.

A lot like drinking and driving many teens they can get away with texting and driving, but what they don't know is that being behind the wheel and looking at your screen at the same time is a dangerous. While recording yourself behind the wheel is another mistake waiting to happen.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0089, -0.3013,  0.0729,  ..., -0.3853,  0.8886,  0.1620],

"Phones And Driving

Cell Phones are one of the essential items in many of peoples lives. We use them everywhere from looking up your favorite song, everyday news etc. but people are so used to them that they do not realize the dangers that come with it. In this article you will read about the dangers of phones and driving with them. We'll talk about overall what is distracted driving, the dangers that come with it and lastly why you should just put it down.

Did you know over a 1000 people a day are injuried from driving distracted by their phones, yeah not a lot of people either. Many people do not realize the real danger they face when they take their eyes of the road for just a second to change that song. It is a problem many drivers face even when they know its a problem. Many people have grown this into such a habit that it feels almost as second nature to them and don't realize in the moment what they're doing.

1 out of 4 people injuried in a car wreck are said to have been texting and driving. We don't realize how something can affect us before it is too late, whether you just swerve of the road a little bit or hit a tree you realize what you did in the end. When you get behind that wheel you are already putting yourself at risk many people do not realize that roads are one of the dangerous places to be, but when you decide it is time to change that song you put yourself at a significantly higher risk than before.

94% of drivers support banning texting and driving. Texting and driving is a problem everywhere and where they're are many people against it they're are still many people whom do not see a problem with it. When you pick up that phone you are not only putting yourself but others at risk too. I want you to ask yourself this is that sing important enough or that funny text from someone to risk your life over. Many people will say no but many people are hypocritical. You never believe something will happen to you until it does and when it does there is only one person you can blame.

You read about the affects and what using your phone while driving can do. Just take the advice from the many people who went through the affects of what this act can do because they know it better than anybody. Next time you get behind that wheel ask yourself, how risky to I want to be today?

"The conflict of whether or not scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for sometime now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well.

The author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. The author is aware of the fact and describes how, ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Not only does the author describe why dangers are present on the planet Venus, but they also gives analogies in regards to the danger present including the fact that, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans"" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. The author tries to justify the dangers by explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. The author describes, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to say how, ""tempertaures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit"" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas by explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to why studying Venus is not a good idea.

From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.",0,"tensor([[-0.8547,  0.0965, -0.6842,  ..., -0.1587,  0.9385,  0.0866],

As any writer knows, it’s important to have a checklist when preparing to write. To begin, it’s helpful to research what a writing checklist entails. This checklist typically includes elements such as identifying the audience, developing a thesis statement, and planning out the structure of the essay or writing piece. It’s essential to be familiar with this checklist and understand why it’s so important to utilize it in the writing process. 

When drafting an outline, take note of the key arguments of why using a writing checklist is beneficial. Consider adding supporting details of how the checklist helps the writer with organization, and developing a clear purpose and direction for the piece. 

And while the consensus may be that a writing checklist is beneficial, it's still important to explore different opinions and perspectives. Research whether some writers would find a checklist to be too restrictive or even unhelpful in the writing process.

In the body of the essay, discuss both sides and present evidence to support each view of writing with and without a checklist. Consider using anecdotes or other examples to illustrate why one opinion may be more useful than the other. This can ultimately lead to a resolution or compromise on the use of a checklist in the writing process. 

Finally, draft a conclusion highlighting the importance of utilizing a writing checklist. This summary section is the perfect place to link back to the initial points made about the checklist, and suggest that, ultimately, it can be extremely helpful in the writing process for those who utilize it.",1,"tensor([[-0.1802, -0.6455, -0.8308,  ..., -0.3013, -0.0032,  0.3918],

"Dear Senate , it is evident that many people think electoral voting is the wrong thing to do. I think that we sould use another method of voting like popular voting. I feel this way because the president that you might be voting for might win the popular vote but because he had lost the electoral vote he doesnt become president. I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president , and because I think its wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.

Although electoral voting may seem good its not because you dont really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have. In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" it state that ""Under the electoralcollege system , voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldnt be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. also in source 2 it states "" The single bets argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This just show how bad electoral voting can get. So we need to change the way of voting before it gets out of hand.

After reading the passage I see another problem that electoral voting causes , which is that electoral voting is unfair to the people of the united states. It states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" this just explaing that candidate that know that they cannot win your states votes wont even bother to try.

People might feel that electoral voting is the best way to vote because we've always used it, and because it restores some balance that me be needed with larger states. But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problem for us in the past and how dont we know it will not cause them in the future. that why we should change our way of voting.

Electoral voting is a bad method of voting because it is unfair to people, most of the time your not even voting for the candidate you want, and because its like of vote don't count on whether or not we get the president that we would like.",0,"tensor([[-0.4796, -0.1591, -0.3683,  ..., -0.5207,  0.3115,  0.3933],

"When I was younger, I thought that education was a life-long process. I was in high school and I thought that I would have to go to college and get a good job after I graduated. But now, after I have graduated from college, I have realized that education isn't a life-long process.

One reason that I think education isn't a life-long process is because I have had to stop schooling and start working after I graduated from college. I thought that I would be able to stay at my current job for a while, but that wasn't the case. I was only able to stay at my job for a few months before I was fired.

Another reason that I think education isn't a life-long process is because I have had to go back to school to get my degree. I originally thought that I would only have to go back to school once, but I have had to go back to school multiple times. I have had to go back to school to get my degree in accounting, marketing, and business administration.

So, in conclusion, I think that education isn't a life-long process because it is hard to stay in school and get a good job after you have graduated from college, and you have to go back to school multiple times to get your degree.

"I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think that this is because they are busy with their own lives and their own interests. I think that young people should be more involved in helping their communities because they can make a difference.

"Video games have been a part of the entertainment landscape for decades, and their influence on modern culture is undeniable. While some may dismiss video games as time-wasting distractions, they provide unique opportunities to explore inventive stories told through interactive media. In particular, role-playing video games have become increasingly popular due to their player agency and immersive storytelling capabilities. Role-playing (RPG) video games are distinguished by their open world environments that players can freely explore and make choices in order to progress in the story. The most popular RPG franchises include classics such as Final Fantasy and Elder Scrolls, but new titles like Cyberpunk 2077 aim to bring gamers unprecedented levels of immersion with advanced graphics technology and character customization options. These RPGs allow users to express themselves both aesthetically and narratively; design characters from scratch or craft customized weapons that match their playstyles. Plus, unlike more traditional forms of gaming like first-person shooters (FPS), there is no single goal or winner – every experience is unique based on how the user decides to interact with the game’s characters and environment. That being said, RPGs also come with risks associated with long hours spent playing them without proper breaks or moderation; compulsive behavior can lead to physical exhaustion, social isolation, financial strain due to costly purchases within certain RPGs (like those found in mobile apps). Additionally, these digital worlds may present moral dilemmas that young people lack the maturity or mental fortitude needed for navigating them safely – not all content featured in RPGs will be appropriate for everyone regardless of age rating systems used by developers/publishers. . Despite potential drawbacks related addiction risk factors or adult themes encountered during gameplay sessions,, role-playing video games offer incredibly appealing experiences for many individuals who seek out meaningful interactions between themselves and electronic entertainment media . Providing escape from reality where players can carve out stories uniquely tailored towards them cannot be understated - it's what makes RPG protagonists feel like “real people

"Why should someone seek out the opinions of other people to make a decision? Well, seeking the opinions of others while trying to make a decision is helpful in many ways. Speaking to a trusted friend will help one make a decision because he or she would want what is best for his or her friend. Also, different points of view are crucial in decision-making because the only way to make a well-informed decision is to be well-informed on all the possible choices you can make.

Primarily, good friends should want what's best for other people, so their opinions will be what they think is the best choice to solve a problem. This also applies to the advice of professionals such as doctors. Doctors are there to help people get healthy, so they will want whatever is best for their patient. A time when I used the advice of others was when I had to decide between going on a school trip to New York City or participating in my school's band concert. I sought out the advice of many of my friends. I trusted those people, so I knew that they would tell me what they thought was the right decision for me to make.

Another benefit of listening to other opinions is that hearing different points of view can make one realize all the aspects of the decision. Usually, humans are hard-wired to think that there is always a right and wrong way of going about things. Opening up to different viewpoints is an excellent way to help yourself make a decision because other people will share why they think their answer is right. This makes a person more knowledgeable about his or her problem, allowing him or her to make a more informed decision. This strategy has helped me make a decision in the past. When I was trying to decide between going to New York City or staying to help my band play well at our concert, many of my friends had contrasting opinions. My friends from band class compelled me to stay because this was our most important concert of the year, and the band always played better when everyone was there. On the other hand, my friends who were going on the trip pointed out that this was a very special opportunity that I had to take advantage of. I used their advice to help me make a good decision.

The advice of others eventually helped me make a decision, as it has helped many others. If someone asks for the opinion of someone he or she trusts, that person is sure to give advice that he or she thinks is best for their friend. Hearing different viewpoints than your own is also helpful in making an informed decision. While making a decision, it's important to keep the advice of others in mind. However, at the end of the day it is the duty of the individual to make his or her own decision.",0,"tensor([[-0.1541, -0.3398, -0.6403,  ..., -0.0249,  0.2663,  0.5728],

"""With less cars we have less accidents and less problems "". As a teenager i should be getting prepare to get my learner license but i do not bother because thats not my priority that doesn't mean i'm not interesting in driving but everything i need are close by like the mall , restaurants and a lot of other thing so i dont really see the need to be driving. By limiting our car usage we prevent accident and we payless bill such as car insurance and gas money.

""After a day of nearrecord pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city "". Every country should have more than one day where we are carfree because that will protect the air we breath by bringing the congestion down and also we will have less car accident. where everyone can take the bus or we can just walk to wherever we need to go. it would be a good opportunity to lower the cars accidents and the pollution.""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car , and that will have to change "" we can centered that development on something better , on something that will be on our benefit and that will help us to move forward not that the cars doesn't help us but it also pollute the air we breath and we need the air more then we need the cars , might as well reduce the development of car to protect ourselves. ""In previous bills , 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport "".

buying a car and still have to pay all those extra money is a a pain and a waste money. Those money could got to your kids college funds or for vacations , putting yourself in a situation to have too much in your plate is not worth it ,why be always tense when we can be happier. That is too much money just on cars who will bring more trouble then anyone deserve. ""A study last year found hat driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 "" young people have found out its not that fun having to drive around.

"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, this technology might help teachers identify how engaged or interested students are in the lessons, and notice students who need emotional support. It could provide teachers insights into students' understanding of the material based on their facial reactions. This could potentially improve teaching methods to better meet students' needs. However, there are also privacy and ethical concerns. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent could make some students uncomfortable and infringe on their privacy. It may discourage natural emotional reactions if students feel like they are constantly being watched and analyzed. There is also a risk of misinterpreting facial expressions, as cultural and individual differences exist in emotional expression. Before using this technology in classrooms, more research needs to be done to address these issues and determine if the benefits truly outweigh the risks. Parental consent would also be necessary. Overall, while FACS may provide some useful insights for teachers, schools must tread carefully and prioritize students' well-being, development and privacy when considering invasive technologies in the classroom.",1,"tensor([[-0.4027,  0.0621, -0.3421,  ..., -0.4544, -0.7368,  0.4824],

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living has led to a growing trend of limiting car usage in many parts of the world. This shift away from car-centered suburban life has numerous advantages, some of which are highlighted in the passages provided.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban, it is evident that the reduction in car usage resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. Smog, which is a common problem in many cities, is exacerbated by car emissions. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for all residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is mentioned as an example of a car-free district where residents have access to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance. This shift in city planning not only reduces the need for extensive road networks and parking spaces but also promotes a sense of community and encourages physical activity.

In addition to the environmental and urban planning benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our personal well-being. Many residents of Vauban expressed their newfound happiness and reduced stress levels after giving up their cars. The reliance on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, road rage, and the constant rush to get from one place to another. By embracing alternative modes of transportation, individuals can enjoy a slower pace of life and connect more with their surroundings.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages provided, are clear. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality but also creates more compact and accessible communities, fosters a sense of community and well-being, and promotes a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living. As we strive to create a greener and healthier future, limiting car usage is an integral part of the solution.",1,"tensor([[-0.4659, -0.0557, -0.4660,  ..., -0.4329,  0.0906, -0.0950],

"The importance of a good night's sleep for college students cannot be overstated. With numerous pressures and responsibilities to manage, it is often the case that those in higher education find themselves having difficulty getting enough rest each night. Poor sleeping habits can lead to a number of negative outcomes both academically and emotionally. It is crucial that university students recognize the benefits of adequate sleep and make conscious efforts to ensure they are sufficiently rested during their academic journey. From an academic standpoint, proper sleep allows college students to achieve optimal performance levels in all aspects relating to their coursework; this includes being better suited for following lecture content as well as researching material outside of class time efficiently. Memory retention, attention span, information recall and general cognitive functioning are also significantly improved with proper rest. Sleep deprivation has been found to diminish not only these abilities but energy levels as well; thus sapping motivation when completing assignments or studying for exams becomes more difficult than usual - leading potentially lower grades if no action is taken against it ahead of time. In addition, mental health issues can arise from inadequate amounts of sleep on a regular basis such as depression, anxiety or stress related reactions due to feeling overwhelmed by everything on one’s plate at any given moment coupled with exhaustion making matters even worse in some cases – especially among those already vulnerable due previous experiences prior coming into college life as well-known fact now days . To counteract such effects taking place it's important establish healthy sleeping patterns while attending school which will prevent burnout from occurring soon afterwards too since balance out stressors from daily dilemmas most likely experienced given amount knowledge required process thoroughly understanding subject matter itself . In order do so individuals could try couple things like forming strict bedtime routine (even weekends worth noting!) reducing caffeine intake after certain hour abstaining screen devices least few hours prior turning off lights improve quality shut eye obtained ; these simple steps alone have great deal impact overall productivity should taken seriously every chance get!. .

"Senator [Your Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen and a student deeply engaged in understanding the political processes of our nation. After reading a number of texts and observing the shifting debates in political discourse, I ask you to consider this: the Electoral College, although an unconventional system, may still be pivotal in ensuring a balanced political power distribution across the states in our country. 

The Electoral College has been enmeshed in American history since the time of the founding fathers, established as a compromise between direct popular vote and congressional vote (Office of the Federal Register, Passage 1). It has been designed in a way that each state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation (Office of the Federal Register, Passage 3).

The critique of the Electoral College being undemocratic in the modern sense is acknowledged yet countered with compelling practical reasons in defence of the system (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 15 and 17). Firstly, certainty of outcome is a key factor to retain. Although Electoral College disputes are possible, they are less likely compared to the popular vote (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 18). Secondly, the Electoral College grants presidential candidates the requirement to have trans-regional appeal encompassing the interest of all regions in our diverse nation (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 19). 

The criticism that the electoral votes are distributed in a winner-takes-all manner, leaving many voters feeling ignored as candidates focus only on ‘swing’ states is valid (Bradford Plumer, Passage 13). However, this system prompts an essential discourse and exchange on pivotal issues in these regions, ultimately offering the populace a more informed choice (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 20). it also makes larger states more influential in the electoral process (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 21). Moreover, the Electoral College reduces the need for run-off elections, simplifying the process (Judge Richard A. Posner, Passage 22).

The Electoral College has often been labelled as archaic and non-democratic (Bradford Plumer, Passage 14). However, direct elections carry their own risks. The potential for election results to be fragmented across multiple candidates could result in a candidate being elected with only a small fraction of the popular vote. A shift to a popular vote could potentially encourage more voters but it also risks marginalising less populous states and regions.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical implications and nuanced benefits that the Electoral College presents. Reforms may be necessary but a complete abolishment of the system fails to recognize its potential to maintain a balanced and representative democratic process. I appreciate your attention in considering the critical role the Electoral College continues to serve in our electoral system.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.4634,  0.0612, -0.5466,  ..., -0.1565,  0.1220,  0.5341],

"I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think that they should more carefully consider how they can help their own communities and how they can make a difference. I have several specific examples to support this belief.

First, young people should be more carefully considering how they can help their own communities. They should be more aware of the opportunities and challenges that their communities face and the ways in which they can help. They should also be more careful about what they say and do that could help their communities.

Second, young people should make a difference in their own communities. They should be more careful about what they say and do that could make a difference in the lives of their friends, family, and neighbours. They should also be more careful about what they do not say and do that could have a negative impact on their communities.

Overall, I think that young people should more carefully consider how they can help their own communities and make a difference. I think that this will help to create more positive and productive communities.

"I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are many benefits to having a broad knowledge base, including the ability to communicate more effectively with others and to think more critically.

One example of the benefits of broad knowledge is the ability to understand complex topics. For example, if I know about economics, I can better understand the effects of government policies on the economy. This understanding can help me make more informed decisions about my life and the lives of others.

Another benefit of broad knowledge is the ability to find solutions to problems. If I know about physics, I can find solutions to problems involving physics, such as how to build a bridge that will withstand a hurricane. This type of problem-solving ability is important in many fields, including business and engineering.

Broad knowledge also gives you a better understanding of the world around you. By understanding different cultures, religions, and perspectives, you can better understand the world around you and the people in it.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to have broad knowledge in order to be successful in life. The benefits of having a broad knowledge base are numerous, and they are often overlooked. I hope that this essay has shown you the importance of broad knowledge, and that you will consider taking advantage of the benefits it offers in the future.

"how conserve energy and resources

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource.

Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. We are going to understand that is necessary protect our resources, because they are indispensable to keep us alive and keep going with this life what we have in the twenty-one century.

You want to improve in something or solve a problem but you just don't know how to execute this issue. In that case you might ask for someone's help on how to do things. But be careful who you ask. If you ask the wrong person, then they can give you the wrong answer and then give you the outcome that you don't want. That's why it is important to ask multiple people if you want to get advice and have a great outcome of what you do.

Just because they are your friend does not mean they are the right person to ask. Asking the wrong person can increase the probability of you making the wrong choice. Bad people don't really see other people's view of life or what other people think because they only care about themselves. Getting advice from those type of people is not good because if you continue to get advice from these type of people then you end up being a bad person yourself because you get into a habit of doing the same acts that those bad people do. The wrong person to ask however is not always a bad person.

Asking the right person however, will help you get a better outcome. A person who can see the bigger picture or someone who is very well experienced is a great person to ask. What I mean by someone who is well experienced is for example, let's say your a swimmer. Your a very good swimmer but you want to improve and get faster. would you rather get advice from someone who doesn't know how to swim or would you get advice from Michael Phelps, an Olympic swimmer legend.

The reason why you should get multiple people's advice and opinion's is so that you all the possible ways you execute something. For example you get advice on how to swim butterfly from Michael Phelps and Caleb Dressel, another great swimmer who actually recently broke Michael Phelps's world record. Everyone has there own little trick or way they swim, Michael and Caleb did not learn the same way as each other. If you get the advice of both of them on how to swim butterfly you could the pros and cons on there different ways of swimming and make a hybrid on how to swim butterfly faster. Living with just one person's opinion is never good.

And this idea started hundreds of years ago. That's why we have the Constitution and a democracy, so everyone has a say in America and there opinion is always valid. Asking multiple people for advice is great because you can get the best of all of them and then use them to make a better choice.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0288, -0.2376, -0.4205,  ..., -0.3319,  0.7128,  0.3942],

"University education is a highly debated topic. Some people believe that it's primary purpose is to prepare students for employment, while others believe it has other functions. In my opinion, university education has multiple functions, and preparing students for employment is only one of them.

First of all, university education is a great way to expand one’s knowledge and understanding of the world. Students are exposed to a wide range of topics, from history and literature to science and mathematics. This helps them to develop a better understanding of the world around them, which can be beneficial in many aspects of life. Additionally, university education also helps to develop critical thinking skills. Students are encouraged to think critically and analyze different perspectives, which can be useful in many areas of life, such as problem solving and decision making.

Moreover, university education also helps to develop important life skills, such as communication and teamwork. Students are encouraged to work together in groups, which helps them to develop their communication and collaboration skills. These skills are essential for success in the workplace, as well as in other areas of life.

Finally, university education also helps to develop important social skills. Students are exposed to a wide range of people from different backgrounds and cultures, which helps them to develop empathy and understanding. This can be beneficial in many aspects of life, such as in the workplace, where it is important to be able to work with people from different backgrounds.

In conclusion, university education has multiple functions, and preparing students for employment is only one of them. University education helps to expand one’s knowledge and understanding of the world, develop critical thinking skills, develop important life skills, and develop important social skills. All of these are important for success in the workplace, as well as in other areas of life.

"The idea that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities is a contentious one. On the one hand, there are many young people who are actively engaged in helping their communities, while on the other hand, there are those who are not. In this essay, I will argue that young people are, in fact, giving enough time to helping their communities, and provide examples to support my argument.

First of all, it is important to note that young people are often the most active volunteers in their communities. For example, in the United States, the Corporation for National and Community Service reports that young people between the ages of 16 and 24 make up the largest age group of volunteers. This is especially true for those who are in college, as they often have more free time to devote to volunteering. Furthermore, young people are often the most passionate and enthusiastic volunteers, as they are often eager to make a difference in their communities.

In addition, young people are increasingly engaging in activities that benefit their communities in more indirect ways. For example, many young people are actively engaged in social media campaigns that raise awareness about important issues. This can be a powerful way to make a difference, as it can reach a large number of people and can often lead to tangible results. Furthermore, many young people are also engaging in political activism, which can have a direct impact on their communities.

Finally, it is important to note that young people are often the most creative when it comes to finding ways to help their communities. For example, many young people are starting their own businesses or nonprofits that are focused on helping their communities. This is a great way for young people to make a difference, as it allows them to use their creativity and energy to create something that can have a lasting impact.

In conclusion, it is clear that young people are, in fact, giving enough time to helping their communities. They are often the most active volunteers, and are increasingly engaging in activities that benefit their communities in more indirect ways. Furthermore, they are often the most creative when it comes to finding ways to help their communities. For these reasons, I believe that young people are giving enough time to helping their communities.

"Abolishing the Electoral College sounds like an excellent idea. The election by popular vote is most definetly without a doubt, more fair for the people. Why are 538 people the ones who get to decide who becomes president and not the rest of us? The Electoral College is outdated and too old for todays society. Lets get rid of this while we can.

The Electoral College was made many years ago by the founding fathers, this can tell you it is outdated. People used to have completely different political views back then, we need a fresh start on how we want it today because things have changed. We the people should vote on what we want now an Electoral College vs. a popular vote by the people and redecide since it has been over a thousand years later.

""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" says Bradford Plumer in source two. Plumer is right about this, the electoral college is very unfair. How can 538 people decide what happens for the rest of us? It should not be like this, everyone should be equal and all vote then go with the most popular vote for the president. We need to change our ways now before the next election.

Some people may argue like Richard Posner in source three that ""the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.."", basically saying the electoral college makes things more equal and fair. What is not fair is that everyone doesn't get to vote directly only the electors do. Many people don't agree with Posner and they shouldn't because the electoral college is the wrong way to run things.

Lets make changes to our future, and abolish the Electoral college. We need to have an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Fairness and equality is the route we need to take.",0,"tensor([[-0.3362, -0.0139, -0.0760,  ..., -0.4516,  0.9283,  0.1700],

"Cars have been around for a while now and have been advancing and changing each year as time has gone on. People have depended on cars to get them from their job, school, practice for a team and even to just get them to a friends house. In the earlier days such as the 1950's to the 1980's most cars were gorgeous works of art and had style and class and each new model looked significantly different from the last. Alot more people now a days preferred those cars over the ones we have now and not just adult men from age 40 or above but also young teens such as myself simply because they are pretty and most of the engines have a much nicer sound to them. As silly as that sounds it's the truth and basically the only reason, but the problem is that those cars burn gas like it's going out of style, they are very heavy compared to modern day cars because most of them were made out of steel, they weren't aerodynamic and besides the fact that they caused a good amount of pollution, they were also very unsafe if you were to get in a car crash.

From then until now we've been advancing cars by making them aerodynamic, lighter weight, less gas to power them and they are also much safer. Since cars have been pretty much a constant thing and being bought more and more they are starting to become a problem now. The problem is that cars have been polluting the world for a constant and long rate of time and it needs to be slowed down so that the air we breathe can start to become more pure and fresh again. I'm not saying that it was perfect before cars came along either because it wasn't but it was a heck of alot better then than now. Now cars play a big part in not only pollution but also global warming which needs to stop.

A world without cars is impossible, there will always be cars around. Instead a world with a limited amount of car usage, now that's possible. I know I love cars, not all of them of course, like i'm no fan of a hybrid but sports cars and muscle cars catch my eye and I love hearing the roar of a powerful engine and seeing how it all is perfectly pieced together under the hood. I also love the world I live in though and I wouldn't want to pollute it anymore then it already has been but I would never want the world I love to be without the cars that I love either. That's why i'd be willing to stop constantly using cars for transportation and find another way to get to where I need to go.

Not only would the world be better without us constantly using cars but so would we. We wouldn't have to worry about reckless drivers and making sure we don't forget to put our seat belt on. Fathers and Mothers wouldn't have to cry at their sons or daughters funeral bacause they were in an accident. The amount of teen deaths by car crashes from driving under the influence would reduce because we wouldn't be driving nearly as much. Even people with COPD or Aesthma would be better off because they'd be breathing cleaner more crisp air rather than what they have to breathe now.

I would never want a world without cars because I love cars and I even want to make a career out of my love for them and become an Automotive Technician/Mechanic. I still want what's best for the world I live in though and if that means less driving and more walking, jogging or biking then i'm okay with that. People who say they feel the same way should also take action rather than just saying it would be better they should try to make it better. I will try my best to find other ways of transportation rather than driving and I hope others will too. Those are some of the advantages I can think of about limiting car usage and i'm more than sure there are one hundred more advantages to limiting the usage of cars but that's the best I could think of so I hope I had some good points.",0,"tensor([[ 0.3844, -0.0865,  0.1664,  ..., -0.3018,  0.8085, -0.0748],

NASA has been studying this topic since 1976 to 2001. Team Nasa has been reshearching and studying picturers and has come to the conclusion that the face is a landform. We are highly certain it is a butte or Messa .A butte or Mesa is a lava dome. We compared the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it was the same hieght as the face on Mars. NASA has studied pictures that are so high tech that if there was small shacks on the planet you could see it! This reshearch has been fun for team NASA.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of either maintaining the current system or changing to a popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that both options have their merits, but ultimately, the Electoral College provides a fair and practical method for electing the president.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose of the Electoral College. As explained by the Office of the Federal Register, the Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. This process consists of the selection of electors, their vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

One of the main arguments for the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all system in most states. This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College reflects their share of the popular vote. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to disputes, as seen in the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the quirks of the Electoral College.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates. Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This prevents the residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the elected president considers the interests of all regions.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are crucial in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to more informed and engaged voters who carefully consider the candidates' positions and policies. In contrast, a popular vote system would focus candidates' efforts on densely populated areas, neglecting the interests and concerns of voters in less populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against the mal-apportionment of smaller states in the Senate. By allocating electoral votes based on population, larger states receive more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are addressed. This is particularly important in maintaining a political balance among states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, as it invariably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complications and uncertainties associated with elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as the need for additional rounds of voting or runoffs.

While it is true that the winner-take-all system can make voters in states with a strong political leaning less likely to participate in the election, this does not justify dismantling the Electoral College. As Judge Posner points out, approximately half of the eligible American population still chooses to vote, even when their state's electoral votes are predetermined.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, though not perfect, provides a fair and efficient method for electing the President of the United States. It ensures the certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. While a direct popular vote may seem more democratic in theory, it overlooks the practical benefits that the Electoral College offers. I believe that it is in the best interest of our nation to maintain the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider these points when deciding on the issue of the Electoral College. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.4857, -0.2348, -0.3581,  ..., -0.1708,  0.3381,  0.6257],

One of the most important factors in achieving success in life is having a positive attitude. Research shows that having a positive attitude can lead to tangible benefits, such as making a good impression on those around you and inspiring those around you to also be positive. Additionally, having a positive attitude can often lead to gaining favor from others, making it easier to achieve goals.

However, there can be negative outcomes from having a positive attitude as well. For example, it is possible that one can be taken advantage of if they are always eager to help due to their positive attitude. Furthermore, jealousy can stem from one’s positivity if others have a negative attitude and cannot accept success achieved by someone else.

While hard work is also essential to achieving success, it is important to note that having the right mindset also plays a major role. It has been found that those with a strong work ethic combined with a positive attitude have a much better chance of succeeding in life. Ultimately, a positive attitude can make a huge difference in how successful one is not only in their career but in life overall.",1,"tensor([[ 0.1725, -0.2385, -0.5303,  ..., -0.5958,  0.1909,  0.3831],

"Cars, the pride and joy of many people. They may look nice and go fast, but they hurt the environment more than most people would know. If Americans in certain places used public transit or walked, air pollution would go down by 50% in those areas. It would be better for the environment, and for the human body's health to reduce the amount they drive in their personal car.

To begin, cars are the second most cause of air pollution in the United States behind power plants. Since the end of World War II the U.S.A has been idolizing cars, and they have been focusing on the production of these cars. In Vauban, Germany there is a ratio of 3 to 10 people who own cars. Only 30% of the population owns a car, which is saving the air from quite a bit of pollution. Another event that will help lower pollution would be banning driving cars for a day or two. In Paris, there was so much smog that it was compared and even rivaled Beijing, China; which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. The people who drove their cars on this day would be fined $31 American dollars. The public transit was free of charge because it was being promoted to use, as it helps the air become less polluted. This event also happened in three Colombian cities, Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar. The ban on the cars made many people seem to be happier, and more energetic. This ban has been happening for three years now in Bogota, and other Latin American cities are now seeing the importance of it. The use of bicycles, the public transit, or even walking helps reduce air pollution in your city.

In addition to not using personal cars, walking from jobs or to the mall has seemed to make many people in these driving bans less stressful and much happier. From government officials to the commonfolk of the street, all of the Colombians in Bogota look much happier. Even rain hasn't stopped them from biking to work. One woman in Vauban, Heidrun Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She does not own a car and lives a happy life. She even sold her car to move here, along with 57% of other families who live in the town. Not only does the relaxation of not driving make you less stressful, it also makes you get more excersize. Since 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, we can assume that they are one of the healthiest cities in Germany or even the world. If all cities in Europe were nearly identical to Vauban then they would have only 3% greenhouse gas emissions from cars, but they would also have a much lower rate of obesity. Even in some parts of the United States, car emissions would go down by 50% which would, in turn, cause obesity to go down by a gigantic number as well. The use of bicycles and your feet would greatly reduce obesity along with increasing happiness.

Although some people may argue that people who don't own personal cars will use public transit instead and societies without personal cars will not have a decreased obesity. This may be true, but if people use public transit then they are helping the environment even more than themselves. They would still have to walk to and from the bus stops. Which will decrease obesity although it may not be in as big of numbers as we would like.

In conclusion the absence of personal automobiles would greatly reduce the air pollution in most major cities. Beijing could become it's once beautiful city, and Paris wouldn't have to ban driving because of thickened smog. The United States would also never have problems with smog, and we would also reduce air pollution by 50%. Communities like Vauban and Bogota are prime examples of people who do not need cars to survive. They are stress free, and much happier than most car driven societies. Personal cars do much more harm, than good. This is why we do not need to rely on the use of personal cars.",0,"tensor([[-0.0477, -0.3854, -0.0316,  ...,  0.0868,  0.4734, -0.1245],

"Im Evan and a guy at my work named John says that the Face on mars was created by alien's. I told him ""Its not created by aliens and me and others at NASA have proof"". He said ""show me the proof than EVAN!!!"". So I then went to get my boss and asked him if i could see the pictures and articles about the face on mars. He said i couldn't see them right away because he needed them so i gad a wait a whole day. The next day my boss handed me the paper and i was so exited to go to John's face and show him the facts.

The first things i showed him were the 3 pictures because it shows how it looked over all those years. Then i showed what NASA said, which was ""Huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars.

It was a pop icon, it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!!! I told john ""Even only a little bit of scientists believe the face was an alien articraft.'

Encountering the face on mars was not an easy task i told him, and they just don't pass over it very often said Garvin i told him. They even took other pictures where the pixel size was 3 times bigger so if there was other objects like aircraft or pyramids they would be able to see them. The face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Then i asked him ""Now was that enough proof for you to believe me' and he said i'll tell you tomorrow. John went home and did research, when he came back he said ""yes I believe you now."" After that i was like want to be friends and he said Yes.",0,"tensor([[-1.0271e-01,  2.8695e-04,  8.8054e-02,  ..., -3.7185e-01,

"Venus may be easy to spot in the nightsky, being nicknamed the ""evening star,"" but it's not so easy to examine. There have been attempts to land spacecrafts on the planet; however, none have survived more than a couple hours. There are many factors that contribute to the difficulty of exploring Venus, but that won't stop NASA from trying to get as much information that they can get. The author thinks that it would be beneficial to explore Venus, but is it really worth trying to explore the planet despite all of the difficulties?

What factors exactly make the exploration of Venus so difficult? Although Venus may once have been ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" it no longer appears to be that way. According to the article, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Also, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are nothing like ones that are found on Earth. This environment would crush a submarine and would liquify metals, as stated in paragraph 3. Along with the atmospheric difficulites, weather difficulties also present themselves. The article states that volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes would be a danger to anything looking to land on Venus's surface.

With all these difficulties, how was NASA planning on examining the planet? NASA wanted to study the planet from above. They want to send a vehicle to hover over Venus in order to avoid the ground conditions, as stated in paragraph 5. However, this would limit the amount of information NASA could collect about the ground conditions of the planet and would restrict them from bringing back any samples.

Overall, I don't think think it is worth trying to explore Venus with all these difficulties, and I don't think the author did a good job supporting the idea that it would be beneficial. If anything, I think the author explained why trying to explore Venus would be nothing but harmful. In the artcle, the author discusses the dangers of trying to explore Venus much more than the benefits we would gain. The author provides no imput as to why we should explore the planet other than the fact that curiosity is what lead people to wanting to explore it in the first place. If people took the time to explore everything they were curious about, nobody would have a life and imaginations would be pointless.",0,"tensor([[-0.8615, -0.3009, -0.5249,  ...,  0.0574,  0.9397,  0.3974],

"Limiting car usage would be great for both you and the environment. If we didn't use cars as much, we would get more exercise, save more money, and limit the amount of air pollution we produce. We would start to notice changes for the better in our health, our budgeting, and the condition of the environment. I have gathered evidence from a few different sources to back up these claims. ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta"", and ""The End of Car Culture"" all go into detail about the benefits that did happen or could happen while we limit car usage.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the increase in exercise it will give you. Did you know that 70% of America is overweight? An advantage to walking or biking places that driving doesn't have is that walking or biking will get you active. It will help you burn calories and it will give you the self-confidence of being in good shape. Sure, it might be hot out when you walk or bike places, but this problem can be solved by simply dressing appropriotely for the activity. Wear something that you know you'll be comfortable getting excercise in. One business man riding a two seat bicycle with his wife (instead of driving), said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"", (Source 3). Walking or riding your bike to get places rather than driving to them will give you more time to think. If you think too much on the road, something dangerous is bound to happen. Walking to places is a great alternative to driving not only for your body but for your mind, and this, to me, is a strong advantage of limiting car usage.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is you will start to save money. Gas bills start to add up, especially considering the constant inclination of prices. Not only gas, though, but other costly needs such as getting your car's oil changed or tires replaced can also turn out to be expensive. Cost plays a huge role in whether or not teens and young adults will get a car when legally eligable. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license"", (Source 4). A large amount of teens just now getting their licenses are unemployed, making the car expenses impossible for them to pay on their own, making them rely on usually a parent or relative. Money has always had a significant effect on how people transport from one place to another. Limiting driving all together would save you gas and repair money, and saving money could never be a bad thing.

Finally, a significant advantage of not driving as much is that it would limit the amount of air pollution on this earth. ""...a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"", (Source 1). Though we may not notice it, air pollution is constantly contaminating the earth. Air pollution is extremely harmful to inhale, almost like how smoking is extremely bad for your lungs. Reducing the amount of driving that we do would reduce the amount of air pollution we produce with it. Walking or biking does not pollute the earth the way driving can.

Advantages of limiting car usage are not only good for the environment but are good for us both physically, mentally, and financially. If everyone started to limit the amount of time they spend driving per day, just imagine the change we might start to see in the community. We could start by walking to the grocery store or our friends' houses instead of driving, and then maybe bring on a long-term change, such as walking to school if it's close enough, or walking to the bus stop so you can ride the bus with other kids instead of driving your own car, creating more air pollution. There are other advantages to limiting car usage, but these are the top three advantages we will begin to notice if we act soon enough.",0,"tensor([[-0.0610, -0.3387, -0.3135,  ..., -0.2521,  0.2249, -0.2569],

"Forida senator, I argue to remove the Electoral College and replace it by changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Voting is not fair to the people because they can't vote for the President, only for the state electors, and even if the candidate that won the most popular votes, may not be elected. Also, the winnertakesall system is not fair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they cannot win in or small states and mostly in swing states.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The passage stated in paragraph 10. Voting has changed over many years, but I think that people should be able to vote for the President and have that candidate win the election if they get the majority of popular votes. If the people want to have that candidate as the President, so be it. Although the Electoral College may help by not having a tied election and have a ""Certainty of Outcome"", but it should be what the people want and vote for. In my opinion, it would be better to not feel like you're putting in a vote that isn't what you wanted. The vote from the people go to state electors for them to choose and that is not truly fair to the people.

The candidates should spend time in all states to try to get their vote instead of the winnertakesall system therefore, it should be removed. There are people in the state that have voted for that candidate but they don't go to the state because they only focus on the swing states. I understand that they do go there to try to win the election and become president, but they should at least spend some amount of time in other states. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" As stated in the passage in paragraph 13.

So overall, the electoral college should be replaced by having the popular vote be the decider of who gets to be president. It's fair to the people and to the country.",0,"tensor([[-0.6496, -0.3987, -0.4693,  ..., -0.3893,  0.5302,  0.9362],

"Essay 2: Phones & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because, that's a detraction on the road. If you have kids in the car and you texting while driving and you do not pay attention to the road and your coming on to a traffic light and it's red a car is in front of you, and then you hit the car you could kill you and your kids just from that one big detraction on the road. Say if you lived and you kids died you are going to jail and you have to go to court to pay the people who you hit from behind that one mistake could lead to all of that. Anything can and could put your family in risk and you in risk for your life. You're driving in your car so someone who you know or love text you. A person walking across the road you're not paying attention at all you hit them they lived lucky lived when you hit them, so they stay in the hospital a good 2-3 weeks the police come to the hospital convince the person you hit to sue you they do it. In the mail or the police that convince they person that you hit come to your house and tell you that you have been sued for texting and driving on the road because the traffic lights has a camera on it catches you. Your court day comes up either your license get suspended or you have to pay the person you hit money. It might end up as both.

"The use of robots in the medical field has been rising steadily over the past few decades. With advancements in technology, robots are increasingly being used to assist doctors with a variety of procedures and tasks. This essay will discuss some of the benefits that robots provide to both healthcare professionals and patients alike, as well as potential drawbacks from their increased usage in medicine. One benefit of utilizing robotic technology within the medical field is improved accuracy during surgery or other delicate procedures. Robots are programmed for exact movements and can be more precise than manual labor by hand when making incisions or applying treatments such as radiation therapy. In addition, they have enhanced visual capabilities which can help surgeons better see inside a patient’s body during an operation. Furthermore, automation via robotics allows for faster completion times on certain operations due to its detailed programming so fewer sessions may be needed overall. Robots also offer numerous advantages to patients including reduced risk of infection caused by human contact with bodily fluids and tissues as well as decreased recovery time since surgeries performed using robotic assistance take less time than traditional methods do; this means that hospitals can perform more surgeries daily while accommodating shorter hospital stays after each procedure thus reducing costs associated with health care services. Furthermore, robot-assisted treatment options often cause less pain for patients compared to standard surgical techniques since there is no manual manipulation involved - this makes it ideal for those suffering from chronic conditions like arthritis or Multiple Sclerosis who may not be able to tolerate traditional forms of treatment due. physical discomfort associated with them. . However despite all these positives there are still some negative aspects associated with robotic usage particularly related privacy concerns if data collected about individual patients were ever leaked; Additionally some experts feel that reliance on automated systems could potentially lead to “de-skilling” amongst healthcare providers who would become reliant upon machines instead doing hands-on work themselves leading possibly poorer quality care delivered overall long term if proper training isn't maintained by medical staff members regularly interacting directly with their

"Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car. But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars because they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for.

To start off with, accroding to the article in ''Life Goes On Without Cars'', u could park at a garage but its gotta be ownship and u would have to buy space that cost $40,000, along with a home. For example, u would have to buy a house pay for that rent and also pay for the parking fee that u brought with the house. So with that being said u should just buy a house, and not own a car and just walk, ride a bike ,or take a bus to where every u got to go.

Secondly, now there saying in article ''Driving due to smog'' On Monday motorists with-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following the day. That's not right because you brought your  car, but you could only drive it a certain day (would ever the law says). The understanding that I'm getting is you got to follow the law rules when ever that applies to the goverment people, which is understandable. But my point is I brought my car and i should be able to drive my car when ever I feel like it.

Futher more, Now they  want to have a ''Car Free Day'' In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, they say millions of Colombins hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. For example, If the people did drive on a car-free day they would face $25 fine. So if it rained and u needed to get somewhere you could't drive u would have to take a bus, walk, train, or skate. Or you would be fined.

In Closing, from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car. Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded. So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1318, -0.1780,  0.2887,  ..., -0.0322,  0.9483, -0.1143],

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing network of everyday objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with one another. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more people have begun to recognize its potential for making their lives easier. From voice-control assistants like Alexa and Google Home, to simple doorbells that allow you to see who's at your front door from anywhere in the world, IoT products provide users with unprecedented levels of convenience, security, and control over their environment. Despite being a relatively new technology, IoT devices are already having a significant impact on our daily lives. One way in which this is especially apparent is through home automation systems — interconnected networks of appliances and electronic components that can be controlled remotely or by scheduling certain actions ahead of time. For example, with an automated system you could set up all your lights to turn off when it gets dark outside or program your thermostat so that it turns down the heat while you're away at work each day. Another major application for IoT technologies is energy management — specifically monitoring and controlling energy use within homes or businesses. By connecting various devices to a central hub such as Amazon Echo Plus or Wink Hub 2 customers can access real-time information about how much power they’re using; this data can then be used to identify opportunities for reducing electricity consumption and saving money on bills each month. Furthermore, many modern appliances come equipped with sensors linked directly into smart grid networks allowing them to automatically adjust their settings based on changes in demand across different areas — ultimately helping reduce strain on local power plants during peak times throughout the day or night. Of course there are also some less practical uses for IoT technology too; from pet feeding stations programmed via smartphone app right through to intelligent plant watering systems capable of detecting moisture level in soil before dispensing just enough water required by individual plants – there's no end of creative applications available!. .

"dear mister senator, of course because this is america (and because were idiots) we have a problem. no not taxes,no not jobs or health care. its the president,how we elect the president that is. the electoral college that is. it changes the way we elect our president,and a lot of people don't like that,me being one,and i think we need to just have a straight forward election.

of course you know the electoral college is a bunch of representitives from every state tha have a president in mind when they go to vote in the meeting of the electors. it basically mean your not voting for the president directly,your voting for the electoral to (hopefully) vote for your canidate that you supposedlly ""voted"" for. this system is wrong because it is unfair to those who vote for the other president,but still suceceed in helping the electoral college vote for whatever president they feel like voting for at the time.

this is why i think we should ban it becuase it isn't the fairest (or smartest) way to handle the goverment. yeah,it is a idea created by the ""great"" founding fathers. and yeah,it is a conveinent way sort and group people like a ""who's with who"" method.

but there are a few things that can be problematic like i don't know say bribery from the president to the electoral college,i mean come on it's not like that hasn't happened before,like the whole nixon thing,and Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marlyn Monroe. but,this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get rid of or change the electoral college. then,this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole, and groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO according to source 2. Al Gore didn't win because of the electoral college,even though he won the popular vote! yeah it was created by the founding fathers,and we should respect there great legacy,but that was then and this is now. this is coming from the guy who faught for independence and peace...but had over 200 slaves himself,yeah not much of a hero. 60% of voters prefer a direct election over a electoral college according to source 2.

please mister senator,please make the right choice and choose to abolish the electoral college because it is unfair and calls for curuption. the information will tell that more voters will be happier with a direct election than a electoral college,isn't that what you want? whats's best for the people? it can be changed if you choose to ban it. they may have been the founding fathers in the past...but who are the fathers of today? be the new founding father mister senator.",0,"tensor([[-1.4421e-01, -2.5330e-01,  1.0145e-01,  ..., -2.5858e-01,

"In today's world, we have become a society that is heavily dependent on convenience and disposability. From plastic bags to single-use containers, we have developed a habit of throwing things away without much thought. While this lifestyle may seem convenient, it is also causing significant harm to our environment. In my opinion, I completely agree that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" as we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of.

One of the major reasons for this phenomenon is the rise of consumerism. We are constantly bombarded with advertisements that encourage us to buy more and more products. We are told that we need the latest gadgets, the newest clothes, and the trendiest accessories. As a result, we end up buying more than we need, and we dispose of things quickly to make room for the new.

Another reason why we have become a ""throw-away society"" is the lack of awareness about the impact of our actions on the environment. Many people do not realize the consequences of their actions, such as the pollution caused by plastic bags and the harm caused to wildlife by littering. If we were more aware of the impact of our actions, we would be more likely to take steps to reduce our waste.

Furthermore, our society has become increasingly reliant on convenience. We want things to be easy and quick, and we don't want to put in the effort required to recycle or properly dispose of our waste. This has led to a culture of disposability, where we use things once and then throw them away without a second thought.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" as we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. However, it is not too late to change our ways. By becoming more aware of the impact of our actions, reducing our consumption, and taking steps to properly dispose of our waste, we can work towards a more sustainable future. We need to take responsibility for our actions and make a conscious effort to reduce our waste and protect our environment.

"Why is it good to have a good attitude even if you have a difficult time? When you have a job you cant go to work with a bad attitude people will never come back. In the other hand good attitude make people want to come back and take to you. Even if you have a difficult time at less show a smile for other people to see that can make them feel good,and that might even make you feel batter.

There are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him.

In a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two.

When you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people.

when you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

When it comes to deceptive behaviors, one example is when someone changes their appearance or behavior in order to impress or get something from someone else. For example, if a person is trying to get a job, they may dress more professionally than their usual style, in order to leave a better first impression on their potential employer. Additionally, when individuals feel left out of a group, their behavior can change drastically in order to impress or be accepted by the group, and it can be evident through their tone, body language or even words used. Furthermore, first impressions may give you a good indication of a person's trustworthiness and ability. When observing someone for the first time, the nonverbal behavior, such as facial expressions and physical movements, can be a good indication of a person's true intentions. Overall, it is important to take into consideration these deceptive behaviors as they can potentially give away hints as to what a person may be trying to accomplish.",1,"tensor([[ 0.2009, -0.2619, -0.6959,  ..., -0.4548, -0.3336,  0.1288],

"Many people think that seeking opinions from more than one source can help make a smarter, easier, and all in all a better choice. Most people think that because seeking opinions from others will often lead to the individual making the best choice. Getting opinions from others can not only lead to making the best choice but also it can relieve stress and and make the individual feel accomplished as well.

Getting opinions from others can help you make better decisions in the future because if you have a good experience you can always ask for opinions. For example if you are making a tough decision and you ask for opinions and they are really helpful you would probably ask for opinions again in the future right?

Getting opinions from your piers will not only help you in the future it can relieve stress as well as help the individual feel accomplished of themselves. For example if you make a tough decision backed up by you piers wouldst you feel relieved of stress and abolished? Not only that, if you are making a important decision that takes a lot of time and you get multiple opinions that help that can relieve stress as well.

In conclusion seeking and getting opinions from more than one source will help you make a better choice.

"The impact of industrialization on the U.S. economy during the Gilded Age is a topic that has fascinated historians for generations. During this time period, from roughly 1870-1900, America experienced rapid economic growth and achieved unprecedented levels of wealth and prosperity. The changes brought about by industrialization were remarkable in scope and complexity, having both positive and negative effects on American society. The emergence of new technologies gave rise to powerful economic forces that provided an incredible boost to production capacity and efficiency while simultaneously creating vast wealth disparities between those who owned factories or businesses, versus those who worked inside them. In order to take advantage of these opportunities offered by increased commercial activity, many individuals became entrepreneurs while others acquired skills needed to be successful in newly emerging industries such as steel production or oil refining. This paved the way for the growth of large-scale corporations which dominated much of American industry at this time period due to their advanced methods of mass producing goods at low costs relative to traditional labor practices; however, it also led to exploitation as workers were often subject to dangerous working conditions with little pay or protection from injury or illness due largely in part due to lack regulation within these rapidly developing sectors . Conversely, there were numerous benefits associated with industrialization during this era such as improved transportation networks which allowed people greater access across state lines leading towards higher levels mobility; further technological advancements enabled better communication throughout cities allowing local business owners more opportunity link up with potential buyers nationwide; plus an overall increase in productivity meant wages went up significantly across multiple industries providing thousands with a steady source income enabling them provide for their families back home . Thus even though there was rampant inequality present during this era due its unbridled corporate expansionism , ultimately it can be argued that without its progress United States wouldn't been able become global superpower it is today .

"In 2019 alone there was a reported factor of 8.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes due to distracted drivers. In 2018 the reported number of deaths due to cell phone and electronic device use was 4,637 people. Distracted driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Sending a text message,using your GPS or talking on a cell phone is considered as distracted driving .For this very reason sum states have looked into coming up with a way to prevent drivers from being distracted.

According to the new law that was passed on May 2,2018 anyone driving in the state of Georgia is to abide by the ""No Hands Law"". With this law being in effect,this means any and every person behind the wheel shall not have a phone in their hand or have it touching any part of their body while behind the wheel. If you are caught with the phone in your hand the penalties wi be for your First offense will be a $50.00 fine , Second offense will be a $100.00 fine, and the Third offense is at

$150.00 fine. Points will also be added to your drivers record. Once you accumulate too many points within a certain period of time your license will be suspended or revoked. In addition your insurance premium will increase.

In essence my belief is that drivers should not be able to have a electronic device in their possession,while behind the wheel. The reason I believe this is because there are entirely too many deaths because of distracted drivers. Taking your attention from the role may harm or kill a person. Distracted driving may also cause devastation for family. It may also put a financial burden on families which can affect them mentally as well as physically.

Could you imagine what would happen if people just put down their phones? Can you imagine how many people's lives will be saved? All it takes is for you to put our phone down while driving .You are not only jeopardizing your life but the lives of others citizens as well. The very few seconds that are taken for reading a text message can be the very seconds that can take or harm a life.

There is no other feeling worse than taking the life of someone else's family member. Having to watch that family grieve and bury their loved ones can hunt you for the rest of your life. As responsible drivers remember we are not only driving for ourselves but others as well. Let's all step up and pledge today to participate in the no hands law. This will automatically lead to less accidents and safer driving.",0,"tensor([[-0.1173, -0.4523, -0.0445,  ..., -0.3539,  0.1108, -0.0152],

"When you're trying to make a big decision, it can be really helpful to get advice from more than one person. There are a few reasons why seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial. First of all, no two people are the same. Everyone has their own experiences, biases, and perspectives. So, if you just talk to one person, you might not get the full picture. For example, let's say you're trying to decide where to go to college. If you only ask your mom for her opinion, she might give you good advice based on her own experiences as a parent, but she might not know everything about the school you're considering or what it's really like to be a student there. On the other hand, if you also talk to a current student at the college, they might be able to give you some more personal insights and help you get a better sense of what the school is really like. Another reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid biases. If you just talk to one person, their biases could influence your decision without you even realizing it. But if you talk to a variety of people, you can get a better sense of the pros and cons of different options and make a more informed choice. For instance, if you're thinking about getting a tattoo, you might be tempted to just ask your best friend what they think since they're your closest confidant. But if you also talk to your parents or another adult you trust, they might be able to provide a different perspective on the risks and long-term consequences of getting a tattoo. Finally, seeking multiple opinions is helpful because it can help you feel more confident in your decision. If you only talk to one person and they give you advice that you're not sure about, you might feel uncertain and anxious. But if you talk to several people and get a range of perspectives, you can feel more sure that you've done the right research and considered all your options before making a choice. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can be really beneficial when you're trying to make a tough decision. It can help you get a more complete picture, avoid biases, and feel more confident in your choice.",1,"tensor([[ 0.1375, -0.7394, -0.9078,  ..., -0.0685, -0.0343,  0.6806],

"Distractions while driving could lead to deaths of other civilians. There are reasons why this topic became an actual law. The law was just passed last year that is you're on your phone while driving, that is an immediate ticket. Due to your criminal record (if it's bad) you can even do jail time if you feel you do not apply to this law. The cops of our cities are doing their job by stopping people who does not follow this law.

The main reason why this show not be condoned is, because most of these situations a citizen could get in a car accident. Approximately 1.6 million citizens die due to being on their cell phone while operating a vehicle. Nearly 390,000 people get real serious injuries due to texting and driving. One out of four of every car accident in the United States are due to texting and driving. In my opinion I believe texting and driving is the main reason we have so many deaths every year.

In conclusion, texting and driving needs to be/ stay illegal. That way people will not do it so often, which could decrease the death rate each year. Texting and driving could possibly be the reason why our death rates increase over time. Especially in this day and age, because almost everything now is technology based. In addition, I believe that texting and driving is not safe for yourself or others, so technology should be the last thing you are on while behind and active vehicle. Texts, calls, emails all can wait until you are in a secure place (not behind the wheel) to respond, and also that way nobody could die or have an injury",0,"tensor([[ 0.3213, -0.1132,  0.3408,  ..., -0.2323,  0.5614,  0.1834],

"Is using a computer that reads people emotion called Facial Action Coding should be used of students in class. I Think IT should to show if the student is going trough some hard times and may need some help.

Onereason is that students dont know how to handle things thy can get caught up in soem things that can effect them long term. Some student may come to school and get bullyed and they might not know how to handle something like that and wind up getting hurt because they wont speak up. In stead of talking to a teacher about it they get in to fights and no one will want to hire them and they wind up on the streets with no jod.

Another reason is that people may have trouble with money at home and it would help to talk to them about that because they might try to steal and get arrested for it and wind up in jail when they could have better things to do. there dad might be a drunk and beat him when he is drunk so using this machine we could see the proublems they have and help them with it.

One last reason is people need to get out and see the world and find new things. you never know they might like what they see and want to find a job like this one reading people emotione.

"How would exploring venus be dangerous? Well first of all in the text is states that the planets surface is an average of over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Thats pretty hot compared to the temperatures that we get here in the US. Some countries may be hotter than others but no one is near 800 degrees. That would be a very dangerous trip for any one knowing how hot it is there. It also states that the atmospheric acid pressure ios 90 times greater that what we experience on pur own planet. It also states that this type of environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Yes I agree that many people would want to see up close what things are on Venus but now in time there is no way that we could get a human up there and get samples of things mainly becuase of the pressure and the temperature.

Studying Venus is a definant worth pursuit but like i said earlier the teperature and the pressure is to hard for any human to get up there. Getting even a rock from Venus would help us learn things about the planet that we may not even know about today. They said in the passage that they have gotten robots out to venus but that is still hard to tell anything because Venus is a very cloudy planet, but even with a robot it is still hard to tell anything because of the fact that robots are good but they can't always work the way that you want them to work. In the passage it asks why scientists are discussing further visits to its surface? thats a good question that I would even ask them. The answer to that question is that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Eart-like planet in ur solar system. It says that long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. From what people and scientists have said today about Venus it doesn't sound like it has that anymore. If it is 800 degrees on that planet all the oceans are gone and I don't think that they will return because of that. If your planet is 800 degrees all your oceans are dried up and any type of water is dried up as well.

I agree with the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If you go to Venus you will most likely die but if you don't go how are we going to study anything from that planet, and how are we going to learn anything about the planet itself. It says in the passage striving to meet the challenges presented by venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shold be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In the is paragraph is is saying that even though venus would be very hard to research that we should saty with venus and one day be able to go their and study. even if it is dangerous, some sientists want to go their even for the danger that it may constist of. Going to Venus would be awesome but at the same time I don't know if going their for the risks that it has would be the smartest thing to do. You could go their and 5 minutes leater be dead. I wouldn't want to do that because I would want to live. Some people are different than me because they like adventure and getting out of their comfort zone but for me that wouldn't be the case.

Going to venus would be a huge sucess but the risks that it has I don't know if going their is worth it. Being able to study everything that it has on the planet would be huge. Learing about the things that go on there would also be huge to know. In the end If you as an individual would like to go the Venus and study the planet and the things that go on their you should go for it even at the dangers that it holds. If you are the type of person that enjoys adventure and learning about new things, I would say that this is the type of adventure that you would want to go on. I say this because of the simple reason that Venus has never been searched in depth, I mean in paragraphy two it states that spacecrafts that have landed their have only been able to survive for a few hours. obviously you could explore a little bit with this amount of time but with an entire planet it would be hard to only have a few hours to explore. you could definantly get a decent way with a few hours but because its an entire planet it would be very hard to discover new things because the craft can't go very fast and the craft can't move as fast as a human would be able to with a few hours. would you rather have multiple humans go out their and research or would you rather have one spacecraft go and research only one way for a few hours. Even if the humans know that they most likely would survive for very long. they could grab somethings that they could put into the shuttle and then the shuttle would return home and the scientists would be able to study later wen the shuttle returns home with all the possible things that the astronauts found on Venus. If Humans went out on a mission to study it states that 97 perscent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. (Paragraphy3) You know how hard it would be for someone to survive in that type of weather. If you send a astronaut to go and research you are basically asking one of you men to go up there and risk his life to study what is up there.

In the passage it says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin But I disagree with that statement. Venus is way more toxic and way for dangerous for humans to go up and study. For one thing the temperature is way to high and the amount of chemicals that could possibly kill you are things that are way to dangerous for any human to go and study. If you send a man up there you are asking him to die to research things that could be useful. if you step onto venus's land you are most likely going to die because of the difference on everything from what your used to. even is suits you are most likely going to die because of the differences. I know I wouldn't want to die.",0,"tensor([[ 5.0260e-02,  2.9118e-02,  4.1113e-01,  ...,  6.2000e-04,

"Venus the second planet from the sun and very dangerous. A thick cloud of carbon dioxide and heats to high for the humen body, but desipite all of the dangers the autor of this passage still wants to go. Despite all of the dangers is this really worth to pursuit.

The aurtor gives us a idea in paragraph 3 of how dangerous Venus is. A 97% thick cloud of carbon dixoide. Heats high enough to kill a humen, up to eight hundred degress! Thunder storms with frequent lightnign strikes that would kill a humen if stuck by one. Lastly its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earths that would crush a submarine, machines built to withstand pressure! Many more dangers await us on Venus but the possiblity behind all of these dangers is amazing.

The reason the autor wants to go to Venus is just because of human curisotiy and insight of the planet itself theres no real claim for anything else. (NASA) is the only scientific reason stated but even then all the text the autor shows is making a craft to just hover over Venus nothing about actuly exploring the plant. The autor's aproche to this subject could have been more enhancing if they would have given scientfic reasons then just for human curisity.

Venus the sister to earth if she had deadly wepons and was ready to strike you if you got close.

"When you give someone advice you want to give them the best advice you can, right? In my opinion you should give them the best advice you can and if you don't then they can go see someone different. I think that you should try to see multiple people for advice. You should get multiple people's advice because if you only get one person's advice then the information might be bias, what they are telling you might not be correct, and it might be bad advice.

The first reason you should get advice from more than one person is the information might be bias. It might be bias because if are only hearing it from one person and only being told what they want you to know. If you only get advice from one person then you will only know one side of the story and then you wont know if they are right or wrong.

If you get bias information then you might never know the truth or you might not know what actually happened. You shouldn't get bias information because you might not be correct and you might also not know the truth.

The second reason you should get more than one persons advice is that they might not be correct. It might not be correct because you didn't hear from more than one person so then you only know what they think is correct and that might be incorrect. It also might not be correct because you only know what they want you to know so then you cant be sure of what the truth actually is. Your information might be incorrect because you only heard from one person, you only know what they know, and they might not be telling the truth.

Finally, what one person is telling you might just be bad advice. Some time people don't give good advice because they want you to get in trouble or they don't like you. Their advice could be bad because they might not know any better. Their information might be wrong because they might not know better, they may not like you, or they might have been thought that it is the right way when it is actually the wrong thing to do.

In conclusion, if you don't get multiple people's opinions then the information might be bias, it could not be correct, and it may just be bad advice. I believe that getting multiple peoples advice is very important in making an important decision. I think that you should get different peoples information because one persons idea could be different than others might be",0,"tensor([[ 0.0586, -0.2426, -0.4399,  ..., -0.4103,  0.4648,  0.1158],

"There is NO way the ""Face on Mars""

was created by alieans. There is definte information that proves anyone wrong that thinks is was created by aliens. First it was proven is was just shadows. Second in 2001 we took a picture in extremely high reslution that shows that is just a mound. Finally if it were created by aliens we would have a man on Mars by now.

The article states in the end of paragraph 2 that is it fake. it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah"" This is coming from the leading scientists in the field of space, and that is a small field in witch only a select few get to be in. Just that alone is engouh to prove any conspiracy theory wrong!

In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture in its highest resolution, each pixel was only 1.56 meters wide as opposed to the 43 meters of the Viking photos. what the picture actually showed was a Martian mesa, a landform similer to the ones found in the American southwest. The face as it turns out is only just a mesa, and that is nothing special.

Finally if it were created by aliens don't you think we would be there. The funding that would poor in would be more than enough to put a man or woman on mars. Since it is just a rock formation not created by aliens we have ablsoutely no motive to go there, none at all.

"Phones & Driving

Well to begin with, I think drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I think drivers shouldn't use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving or even looking at something on your phone while driving can be very risky for you.

Personally i wouldn't text and drive. When driving you have to be very cautious. Cautious for you , not only you but other too. First off texting and driving is illegal. If you get caught by the police you can get a ticket for it or worse. Majority of the people today don't care. They would rather text back immediately when it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car.

I know for a fact it's dangerous because just a month ago my cousin and 6 of my friends got in a bad accident. The accident was so tragic that my cousin and 4 other friends died and only one of them manage to get out. The driver that hit their truck was drunk. Not only was he drunk but he was texting as well. When driving you should never text. If you think the message is that important you should at least go park your car and go from their.

They have commercials on tv about texting and driving. Also on billboards, youtube, and etc. A lot of people text and drive still to this day. But it's most definitely not safe. I think banning cellphones while driving would be a good thing to do. Everyday people die from car accidents. Because of the use of using their cell phones while driving.

We've all became attached to our cell phones. However there is a dangerous side to cell phones. That is using it while driving. It is very dangerous. Also it can cause of harm to yourself, not only yourself but others as well. When you are driving you have to be cautions and know that your driving for others too;",0,"tensor([[ 0.3569, -0.3809,  0.1264,  ..., -0.2949,  0.3020,  0.5784],

"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral college , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the RunOff Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most appalling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family. People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for.

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much. In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""source 3. Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote. Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are voting for.Thats why the Electoral College shouldn be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake.

RunOff elections , sounds like a tedious process. When RunOff elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process. We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be. People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left. THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" source 2. Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good. Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes. This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president.It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is. The Electoral College is like a helping hand.",0,"tensor([[-0.2281, -0.2132,  0.0274,  ..., -0.6822,  0.8846,  0.4665],

"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;that's why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy.

Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals.

Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life.

There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions.

Concluding with paragraph one,two and three,'' working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,''. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,''that is gonna be your legacy,''. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.

"Few things are more exciting than the prospect of attending college. College is a time to meet new people, explore different ideas and discover who you are as an individual. Although it can be nerve-wracking at times, the unique experience of attending college offers countless opportunities for personal growth that make all its challenges worth enduring in the long run. Attending college allows students to expand their knowledge by taking courses outside their comfort zone. Students have access to a wide range of classes taught by experienced professors and professionals with valuable industry knowledge. This can often lead to interesting conversations about topics you wouldn't necessarily discuss elsewhere or learn about on your own, which can put into perspective how your studies will prepare you for future success in whatever field you pursue after graduation. It also gives students the chance to become involved in activities and organizations related to their interests such as student government, intramurals, volunteer programs, research projects or internships where they gain invaluable skills that may set them apart from other applicants when seeking jobs post-graduation. College also provides social benefits through building relationships with peers while living together in dorms or apartments; meeting others during campus events; joining clubs and organizations; participating in team sports like football or baseball; studying abroad and experiencing different cultures first hand; attending school functions such as dances, pep rallies and concerts - all activities which create life-long memories shared by many alumni today! From roommate disagreements to making friends who quickly become family members - there's no shortage of stories shared year after year among former college classmates about what makes this stage of life so special & memorable for everyone involved!. Last but not least is self-discovery: something essential every student should experience during his/her undergraduate years regardless if it involves switching majors multiple times or struggling between course selections until finding one’s true passion - this crucial journey through trial & error helps shape future ambitions while simultaneously giving individuals confidence needed later down the line (especially when

"Despite the conditions on Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit. He supprts his idea by showing the reader how important Venus's surface is. He also talks about why scientists are still curious about Venus and why Venus's history can be important geographically.

Long ago Venus was very earth like. Venus had a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar features like valleys and mountains. The planet was also largely covered with oceans. in hopes of venus returning like its older self, scientists are looking into a way to explore the planet, but with its challenging conditions scientists are looking into more options rather than sending humans which could be disasterous and wouldnt be very safe in those unimaginable conditions. The author goes in depth as to way scientists are trying to find an alternative to sending humans. With ther conditions of Venus its dificult for scientists to find a sollution.

"Phones & Driving

Bologna and cheese! Pepperoni and pizza! Peanut butter and jelly! These are all things that go together. What doesn't go together it's texting and driving. Cell phones have become so commonplace that people don't see how much of a danger they can be. Cell phone use should not be permitted while driving. Cell phones should be stored away/out of reach while driving a vehicle. Some of the reasons cell phones shouldn't be allowed while driving include distraction for the driver, leading to increased deaths or increase accidents.

Distracted driving accounts for approximately ""25%"" of all motor vehicle fatalities according to the website Teensafe. com. Teens make up the largest group of distracted drivers. Because of their inexperience accidents involving teen could most likely involve in death. Cell phones are a major cause of distracted driving resulting in more than 400,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths each year according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (www. geotab. com) Drivers can also get distracted by eating or drinking, worrying about the radio, reading directions, talking/texting( anything that has to deal with cell phone use.)

Road rage also accumulates with cell phone use because being on the phone while not paying 100% to the road could lead to accidents which could lead to a road rage between drivers. 50% becomes aggressors due to the driving habits of others. Unsafe lane changing because of drivers being on their cell phones. People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into accidents than those who drive while intoxicated. More than half of drivers will experience road rage in their life.

There are those who will argue that cell phones aren't any better than any other distractions such as playing with the radio or looking for something in the car while on the road. Both distracted drivers and road rage are common to each other. Road rage is apart of cell phone use just like distractions during driving in an vehicle. Use of cell phone can take an individuals eye's off the road for anywhere from 30 secs to 1 minute whic can result in road rage from cars close by the driver who is distracted. Cell phone use is a part of distractions for drivers which can cause road rage and an conflict between drivers.

Cell phone use while driving is a major distraction which can result in road rage and/or an accident. For many reasons cell phones and driving do not go together. Drivers need to be focused and alert while on the road. Drivers lose focus when they are worried about answering their phone while on the road.

"In the picture that you were showen looks like a face on Mars that many people believe was created by Aliens, Scientist call the face ""Face of Mars"". ""Face of Mars"" has been a pop icon, it has starred in many films, books, radio shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years!

Many people believe this ""face"" has been created by aliens because of how far it it and how barley visible it is, would this prove that there is Human life on Mars? many people believe that their is human life on mars but some people are skeptics. I truly believe that this is just a natural landform. Some believe, like scientists figure it was rock forming and had unusual shadows that made it look like an illusion with a human head, eyes, nose, and a mouth. Authors have reasoned it is a good way to get attention to mars, which has worked. There are three different photos from seperate years that show a face but you can clearly see the face has slowly dissapeared by 1998, by 2001 the face looks like it has faded slowly. Nasa scientists were starting to dissagree at some point but that is okay, people have there own way of beliveing stuff. Most scientists on Nasa believe it has been natural rock formation over the years, they seem to be pretty positive. most scientists like to keep information to their selves instead of saying infromation to conspiracy theorists which can give false information.

Natural Landforms are common around the American West, it makes more sense to prove that it is just natural rock landform coming together forming rock and the shadow illusion of a face, as scientists predict.

"Is the most benefit to work alone because the students learn more, for example: if they work in group they need to divide all the work in always can't all the students learnd all the work because a student do one part of the work and other student also do the other part, but if a student work alone he can learn all the work because he do all the work alone and he know about al work.

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student don't undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student don't work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

But in my opinion I prefer to work alone because I learn more and understand more about any type for example if work alone I need to do all the work and I need to found all the information and do all the examples and explain all about my work, the most important about this two type is learn to working in group and workin alone because sometimes in the future all will work in group or alone,

in both form is good to work and always do the best and each work.

Both have benefits but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students.",0,"tensor([[-0.1209, -0.0769,  0.2517,  ..., -0.9935,  0.6962,  0.0816],

"Dear state senator,

I am writing you today because I find we should not be using the electoral college. It doesn't make much sense to make things so much more complicated than they have to be. Why would we vote for a group of people to vote for us? it doesnt make sense, why not just vote on our own, that way we know we voted for whom we really wanted

? voting for an electoral group is like going to vote and saying ""Hey, im going to vote today for a group that will hopefully vote for the presisdent i want."" I personally would not put my faith in someone who could just so easily change their mind and not vote for my choice.

I do see the reasoning in having an electoral college so that way we are less likely to end up with a tie or any other mishaps. however why would we not instead just have an extra group of say, 50 people to vote if we end up with a tie? I find that would be much easier. people would be able to just vote for whom they wanted and be done with the whole situation.

Remeber the disaster factor? we are lucky that 2000 situation was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows far worse. our legislatures are responsible technically for picking electors, and the chosen electors can always go against the will of the people.

what if a tie does occur in the electoral vote? it nearly happened in 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; in 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in hawaii had voted the other way. the election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winmning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

The electoral college is just not a fair nor good way to handle the voting system and i believe we need to change it.",0,"tensor([[-0.3020, -0.3258, -0.1741,  ..., -0.5794,  0.9332,  0.7590],

"The world is changing every day, and with that, so is the way people live their lives. In the past, it was more common for people to be involved in their communities. They would help their neighbors and work together to make their community a better place. Nowadays, it'seems like people are more focused on themselves and their own lives. They are less likely to help their community, and more likely to just look out for themselves.

There are a few reasons for this change. One reason is that people are busier than they used to be. With work and other commitments, they have less time to dedicate to their community. Another reason is that people are more isolated than they used to be. With technology, people can connect with others all over the world, but they are less likely to connect with people in their own community. Finally, people may be less likely to help their community because they feel like someone else will do it. They may not see the need to help if someone else is already doing it.

Whatever the reasons, it is clear that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities. This is a problem because communities need the help of it's residents to function properly. When people do not help, it can lead to a decline in the community.

There are a few ways to solve this problem. One way is to make it easier for people to help their community. For example, community organizations can offer volunteer opportunities that fit into busy schedules. Another way to solve this problem is to make people more aware of the need to help their community. This can be done through education, either in school or in the community. Finally, people need to be incentivized to help their community. This could be done through rewards or recognition.

Whatever the solution, it is clear that young people need to start giving more time to helping their communities. Only then can communities thrive.

"Dear State Senator,

While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.

The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.

Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.

In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.

Thank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides aswell, while I did not have the time or room to include them.

Your friend,

"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certain places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are actually happy that they put this new type of law. Many people preferred to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help reduce this problem. On mondays motorists with evennumbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emissions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.",0,"tensor([[-0.0488, -0.1002,  0.4502,  ..., -0.6275,  0.9862, -0.0992],

"Nowadays people show their emotions simply just by looking at their face. Today's technology is advancing quickly that they even found a way to tell people's emotions. How can they accurant about they're emotions though? I personally think that only a person can feel what they're going through. I don't think technology is so accurate to look into someone's soul.

Prof. Thomas Huang and his crew discovered a new software that can recognize emotions. However I believe that no one can tell other people how they but them theirselves. How can they actually calculate emotions, only us humans express what we feel, not technology. This software begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is not very accurate.

We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking at their face because you know the person that well. Although most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang studies artist such as da Vinci to help him paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electrical code.

The famous painting Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. It's like saying that your own PC can tell your emotions, it's pretty impossible. To an expert, faces don't lie. Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example, actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowining as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Someone's emtions is way more different than the science of emotions.",0,"tensor([[-0.0180, -0.4171, -0.1943,  ..., -0.0293,  0.3517,  0.6265],

"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Insight

With the increasing global concern about climatic changes and environmental pollution, initiatives to reduce the reliance on cars and promote sustainable living are becoming more prevalent worldwide. This essay will explore the consequences and benefits of car limitations, from improving public health to reducing global warming, using examples from the cities of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, and the current trends in the United States.

Vauban, a suburban experiment in Germany, showcases a unique approach to minimizing cars (passage 1). The absence of home garages, car parks, and the restriction of car-packed streets have encouraged 70% of its residents to live without cars (passage 2). The most apparent benefits include less stress from traffic congestion and a healthier environment characterized by ""verdant streets"" with fewer greenhouse gas emissions (passage 3). It is clear that the reduction in car usage significantly contributes to reducing greenhouse gases and thus aids in curbing global warming (passage 5). Moreover, it promotes a more comfortable, stress-free life for its residents.

Paris, conversely, presents a harsher approach in striving towards lower car usage. In the face of severe smog, the French government enforced a partial car ban (passage 10). This drastic measure led to a whopping 60% reduction in congestion, demonstrating that mandatory restrictions on car usage can have an immediate positive impact on air pollution levels (passage 14). However, such implementation highlighted the need for adequate alternative transportation, highlighted by complaint from delivery companies due to lost revenue (passage 18). 

Meanwhile, Bogota in Colombia achieved a remarkable reduction in car usage through the 'Day Without Cars' initiative. The program led to less air pollution, improved public health, and was positively accepted by the residents despite the imposition of fines for non-compliance (passage 21, 24). The immediate benefits, coupled with infrastructural changes like the construction of bicycle paths, visibly transformed the city’s environment and lifestyle (passage 28). 

The United States also demonstrates promising trends towards less reliance on cars, with Americans buying fewer cars and driving less each year (passage 29). Furthermore, sociologists' future projections suggest a potential decrease in car ownership rates due to increased telecommuting, urban renewal, and proliferation of carpooling apps, signalling a long-term cultural shift (passage 35). At the same time, a shift in demographic trends, with fewer young adults obtaining driving licenses, suggests that this trend may not only persist but accelerate in future years (passage 38). 

It is clear that limiting car usage holds several advantages from the environmental, health, and social aspects. Living examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the trends in the USA have shown us the varied approaches to achieve this goal, and the benefits that follow. As more alternative means of transportation continue to evolve, the dream of a car-free or less car-intensive future might soon become a reality. The shift to such societies could significantly improve our quality of life, benefiting both individuals and our global environment.",1,"tensor([[-0.4470, -0.3718, -0.4466,  ..., -0.1494,  0.2204, -0.1681],

"Research is a crucial aspect of human development that has played a vital role in the welfare of society. The question of where researchers should focus their efforts is, therefore, a crucial one. I strongly agree that researchers should prioritize areas that are likely to result in the greatest benefit to the most people. This essay will provide reasons and examples that support this stance.

Firstly, prioritizing research in areas that benefit the most people ensures that limited resources are utilized effectively. Research is an expensive endeavor that requires funding, equipment, and personnel. Therefore, it is critical to focus on areas that are of utmost importance to society. For example, researchers can prioritize research on diseases that affect a large population such as cancer, diabetes, and heart diseases. These diseases have a significant impact on people's lives, and finding a cure or treatment would greatly benefit them. Thus, by focusing on such areas, researchers can direct their resources towards a cause that has a significant impact on society.

Secondly, prioritizing research in areas that benefit the most people ensures that research has a direct impact on society. Research that produces a tangible outcome is more likely to receive public support and funding. For example, research on renewable energy has a direct impact on society by addressing issues such as climate change and energy security. By focusing on areas that benefit society, researchers can ensure that their work has a positive impact on people's lives.

Thirdly, prioritizing research in areas that benefit the most people ensures that research is relevant. Research that is not relevant to society's needs is unlikely to make a significant impact. For example, research on the mating habits of fruit flies may be fascinating, but it has limited relevance to society. Therefore, researchers should focus on areas that address issues that are relevant to society. For instance, research on how to mitigate the effects of climate change is essential in addressing the challenges posed by global warming. By focusing on relevant areas, researchers can ensure that their work is useful to society.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that researchers should prioritize areas that are likely to result in the greatest benefit to the most people. This is because it ensures that limited resources are utilized effectively, research has a direct impact on society, and research is relevant. Researchers should focus on areas that address pressing issues that have a significant impact on people's lives. By doing so, researchers can contribute to society's welfare and make a positive impact on the world.

"Reducing the usage of cars in today's world could be extremely beneficial. Sure, it is also a hastle having to re-route your commute and also making the time to get there, but the myriad advantages to the reduction of car usage is astonishing. Reducing our usage of cars will reduce the smog in cities, such as Los Angeles, Beijing, and Paris, reduce the stress of many drivers, and also save people money. Now who doesn't love money?

Smog/pollution is growing daily in dense, polluted areas. Looking outside of LA, you can see the dirty, polluted air surrounding the city, as well as the toxic blanket the covers Beijing. One of the main sources contributing to this is cars. Greenhouse gases are emitted from tailpipes and go straight into the atmosphere. In Europe, exhaust makes up fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emission, and accounts for fifty percent in the United States, FIFTY PERCENT. That's half of the pollution in our country, and an easy solution is to limit car usage. If your car usage is not limitable, perhaps switching to a hybrid car such as a Toyota Prius will make you feel good about contributing to the cause. Some areas, like Bogota, Colombia, participate in a Car-free Day. This day is widely celebrated in the area and is infectiously spreading to nearby areas and potentially the world soon enough. This day allows for smog reduction. Cities such as Paris, however, have to ban car usage sometimes because their smog is so bad. During this ban, hybrid cars and carpooling is allowed. This shows the extreme measures necessary to reduce the smog in populated areas.

As most people know, driving is stressful and is perhaps a top contributer of stress in America. In populated areas, rush-hour traffic is annoying and causes many people to change their schedules. When driving during rush-hour, you are in constant fear of potentially being cut-off and your risk of being in an accident heightens dramtically. With that being said, what if I told you there was a way to completely cut out this fear? Communities such as Vauban, Germany are helping alleviate stress by making car-free communities. Within these communities, cars are allowed to be owned, but you must park it in a parking garage at the end of the community and also buy a spot... for $40,000. Cars are used rarely, as restaurants, shops, and others are within walking distance of these communities. Cars are only used for long-distance travel and are permitted on highways and on the outer edges of the area. The stress is alleviated because you can walk outside, grab your mail, and listen to the birds if want, all without the worry of cars. You don't need to constant check your rear-view mirrors if you're walking to your favorite restaurant. With the introduction of smartphones and the constantly growing usage rate of the internet, people don't need cars to communicate anymore. They can simply go on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. to communicate.

Finally, the reduction of car usage allows for people to save money, and a significant amount too. If you live in a neighborhood such as Vauban, there may be no need for a car at all. In today's world, a good car costs somewhere are 30-40 thousand dollars. Imagine what you could do with that much money. You could get a nice house, or travel to your favorite destination, or anything really. You could send your kid to a nice college! And the drawbacks are small, because everything is within a twenty minute walk. That sounds pretty nice to me.",0,"tensor([[-0.1701, -0.2456, -0.1068,  ..., -0.3776,  0.4520, -0.0132],

"The internet has drastically changed the way people learn about and experience music. Now, with just a few clicks of the mouse or taps on a screen, anyone can access virtually any type of music they want to hear without ever leaving their home. This instant accessibility to a diverse range of musical genres has created an entirely new reality for how individuals consume music today. While this new digital landscape of streaming services and endless options carries many benefits, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered as well. On one hand, having full access to millions of songs at your fingertips is incredibly convenient and opens up huge opportunities for exploration in different types of music styles from all over the world. With services like Spotify or Apple Music providing vast libraries filled with almost every genre imaginable, it's easier than ever before for people to discover something new that speaks to them personally; this also encourages experimentation which allows audiences to appreciate various forms of artistry beyond what they already knew beforehand. Additionally, being able to purchase exact tracks instead only buying complete albums makes it more affordable for fans who may not have the means (or desire) for purchasing physical copies—this cost-effectiveness removes another barrier between listeners and their favorite tunes. However, with convenience come certain risks as well; since countless songs are available just a few clicks away online now rather than having go out searching through record stores manually, there's always danger that these accessible digital platforms could create homogeny within popular culture if listeners become too comfortable relying solely on pre-programmed lists/recommendations instead doing independent research themselves—in other words: algorithms deciding what someone hears over personal interests & curation skills could lead to less innovation when it comes creating truly original content within certain genres while limiting chances of lesser-known artists getting exposure because playlists will tend favor established names who generate more revenue streams due higher streaming numbers etc. Nevertheless regardless potential impacts digitalization holds those involved in making & consuming music alike still possess ultimate responsibility ensure

"Well, if i'm being honest with you. I do not believe it is a good thing to do. In certain states, yes. But when it comes to school and kids' education? No. If you put these kinds of computers in schools, all they would do is distract the kids and make them focus on what the computer is doing itself instead of the work. Sure, it can read when you're bored or unhappy. But that doesn't mean it's alright to distract the kids from doing their work.

Alright, so i think it's cool that a computer can tell emotions and how you are feeling and this and that. But in all reality it is just another electronic thing that we do not need in the world. Every year, people and companies come out with more and more stupid ideas for electronics. All i am hearing on TV anymore is about the new iPhones or the new Mac Books. They are cool and all, but you literally just came out with a new one last year. Like it says in the story, ""Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.""

In conclusion, these new tech designs and programs and electronics are pointless and unuseable. There is no point in putting something in a school that will just distract the kids from learning. Maybe having them at popular restaurants and stuff would help. But in schools? No way. Kids nowadays have a hard enough time learning in school, putting these computers in the schools is not going to help them learn anything quicker.",0,"tensor([[ 0.5401,  0.1461,  0.1295,  ..., -0.1701,  0.4570,  0.7003],

Also, i think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's.

"The face on mars could not be made by aliens because the face on Cydonia change over time, its a rock trasformation , and there woukd have been more things to prove life on mars. The thinking that aliens is a bit over bord.

The face on the red planet ""Cydonia"" changed over time. If there was life on Cydonia the face wouldnt have changed like it did. In 1976 it looked like a shadow face. 1998 it had a white tent to it. 2001 it had racks like a rock. The face would had stayed the same if there was living life on it.

Another reason is it looks more like a trasformening rock. People tend to already had a picture of what soemthign is in there head. When the people that took the picture saw this thought it looked like a face. When you tell poeple what something looks like they wont fight you because in there head they seen it. The rock is just a time changing thing. 2001 it dosent even look like a fcae that they try and make you see.

On earth we have thing to prove that we live on here. On the red planet they only found this one thing. If there was life there would be more things to prove it and sooner. 1976 to 1998 is 22 years. In 22 years there has been only one ""face"" found. 1998 to 2001 is 3ish years. The same ""face was there but it was different. So 25 years has pasted on anf there has only been one thing the shows that there could be life on the red planet.

Now I under stand that it does look like a human face yes. And different people have went up there just to take picturse of it. But if there was life on this planet it dont you think it would have shown itself a little bit more and not hide for 25 years giving us one piece of evidence that its real.

If there was live on plante Cydonia it would had been more things to prove it. Also The face didn't stay the same. Another reason is a rock is more believibale then aliens. Just something to think about is they did think there was life on a different planet but earth dont you think they would tell people and not try and hide it for as long as they can.

"The importance of physical fitness for young adults cannot be overstated. It is essential that adolescents and teens be encouraged to take part in a variety of activities to stay physically fit and healthy. From childhood through adolescence, physical activity has been proven to have numerous health benefits—among them weight control, improved cardiovascular performance, decreased risk for chronic diseases like diabetes and better mental health. For teenagers especially, the pressures of school can add stress and anxiety levels that impair their ability to focus during class or study effectively at home. Exercise helps reduce these feelings while aiding concentration by releasing hormones such as endorphins which increase happiness and reduce cortisol (a hormone related to stress). Additionally, exercise increases oxygen flow throughout the body which makes it easier for students to remain alert in class or when studying. In order for young adults to reap the full range of benefits from physical activity they should engage in a combination of strength training exercises along with aerobic activities such as running or biking. Strength training not only builds muscle but also provides protection against injuries caused by everyday activities such as playing sports or even carrying heavy books around school all day long. Aerobic workouts help improve cardiovascular functioning, strengthen bones and joints as well promoting better breathing habits so students can get more out of every breath each time they hit the gym or go jogging outdoors. It is important that parents encourage their kids on this journey towards greater physical fitness; providing support both verbally and financially if need be - whether it’s joining a local sports team or finding an after-school program offering classes like yoga or tai-chi where kids can work on improving both their confidence level alongside their overall wellbeing through exercise. By getting involved early on with regular physical activity children are far less likely suffer from obesity later down the road - something all too common among today's youth due largely in part lack access resources needed stay active into adulthood outside organized sports programs like those offered boys' baseball basketball leagues girls'.

"The Facial Acting Coding System could allow you to express yourself without meaning to. It would be such a helpful thing for students, it could allow them to become smarter or even allow them to get a bad feelng out by letting someone know they are upset or stressed.

The Facial Acting Coding System would allow a student who was confused or bored to get extra help. As is stated in paragraph 6 of they are confused or bored it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor to help them understand. This would allow someone who was quiet and shy that is to afraid to ask for the extra help in class to get the help. They would be able to do so without speaking up in front of everyone and geting embarassed, they could just simply sit there and pay attention allowing the Facial acting coding system to see it.

The Facial Action Coding System would also allow someone who is very upset to get help without having to be straightforward and walk up to someone and ask. It could recognize you are upset as stated in paragraph 3 and it could alert someone that you nee help. You could then have them come to you instead of you having to start the conversation with them and theyd already know you were upset and needed to talk to someone.

It would also be able to find what you are interested in and help you find stuff you like and possibly what you want to do. As stated in paragraph 6 the computer can play an ad and it can see if you like it by the response you have suchas smiling it will play more ads that are like that one or if you frown it can avoid ones like that and play something the complete opposite until it finds what you like. This would also allow you to find people who are similar to you that like the same stuff allowing you to become friends and get closer tothe friends you already had.

The Facial Action Coding System would be a very valuable tool for in the classroom. It would allow students to learn to there greatest ability because it will be able to effectivily modify the lesson when one is confused. It would allow the higher members know if a student was also having trouble and needed talked to.

"Description of

Mona Lisa

What is the difference between smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage - says Constantin Stanislavvsky. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

We humans everyday perform or express the same impressive ""calculation"" such as any subject like math homework or science. Through all this the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. In paragraph 6 lines 6 and 7 this states that while the use of technology can read our emotional expressions ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. In the use of technology then it could modify the use of how people have their emotions and expressions.

Meanwhile, some computers can handle the use of emotions people have and their expressions depedning on how they calculate emotions. Not only can the computer detect the feelings it makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. In paragraph 4 the first line the article says that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). However, everyone has emotions, feelings, and expressions, but some you can not verify or tell how they are feeling or whether they tell you they do not know what is their suggestion to it. Computers need to know that as well.

As in paragraph 2, everyone has emotions that just you can not verify or tell of how they are feeling or their confused and bored. In excluslive this software can be very valuable to many students in very many ways although, it is going to help them with observing many emtional faces and expressions. Not just the computers can help them observe the faces in paragraph 6 lines 8, 9, and 10 ""The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Within this information if students feel sad, worried, and happy this all at once the software in the computer can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

It takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it it takes less muscles just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling, when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7 line 8 ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. It is all about the muscular action units.

In paragraph 9 lines 2, 3, and 4 it says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In this information, To an expert or computer system, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smilimg"" politician or celebrity is not being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!",0,"tensor([[-0.3943, -0.1671,  0.1256,  ..., -0.4651,  0.5189,  0.0713],

"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is like Earth's sister planet. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. There could have been life on Venus at one point. Venus has been difficult to study according to NASA. In the essay it is stated that ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system."" Due to this there is erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes.

Venus is Earth's sister-planet and scientists have speculated it to one have been the most "" Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus is the closest planet to Earth relative to density and size. Venus once had features like Earth, which included being covered with oceans, and could have even supported various forms of life. Venus has valleys, mountains and craters, the same as Earth does.

The atmosphere of Venus and the planet itself is difficult to examine. Venus' atmosphere is estimated to be coated with 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. On the surface of Venus, its temperature could average over 800 degress farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is sometimes 90 times greater that what it is on Earth.

NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's solution to the violent conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above it. A vehicle that is basically a blimp, hovering 30 miles or greater above Venus' landscape. NASA's idea for the ""blimp"" could possibly be a breakthrough because the ""blimp"" would be able to avoid the harsh conditions that is going on below. Although the vehicle would be above the surface, the temperature would still be 170 degrees farenheit.

The author supports the idea that pursuing Venus is worthy.

"Dear Fellow Citizens,

I am writting to tell you about why we should limit car usage. Cars are a big problem for our enviroment and our health.

Firstly, cars make alot of polution. The polution from cars is bad for our air and it makes it hard to breathe. This is bad for people with asthma and other breathing problems. It also makes it hard for plants to grow. Plants need clean air to grow and when there is alot of polution in the air it makes it hard for them to survive.

Secondly, cars make alot of noise. The noise from cars is bad for our ears and it can make it hard for us to think. It also makes it hard for us to sleep. When we can't sleep it can make us grumpy and it can make it hard for us to concenctrate in school.

Thirdly, cars can be dangerous. They can crash into each other and people can get hurt. When people get hurt in car crashes it can be very serious and sometimes they can even die.

Finally, cars are a big problem for our enviroment. They use alot of gas and the gas runs out quick. When the gas runs out it can make it hard for us to find more. It also makes it hard for us to breathe because the gas makes polution.

To fix these problems we should limit car usage. We can do this by using public transportation like buses and trains. We can also ride bikes or walk. These are all better for our enviroment and our health.

In Conclusion, cars are a big problem for our enviroment and our health. We should limit car usage by using public transportation, ride bikes or walk. This will make our air cleaner, make less noise, make our roads safer and help us to breathe better.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.1114, -0.0031, -0.6822,  ..., -0.4470,  0.6248,  0.0627],

"In the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an great job of describing how Venus would be a very worthy persuit depite all of the dangers. Venus is the closest planet to earth. In the essay the author states that it is known as Earth twin. That is in terms of desity and size though.

In the essay the author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement in the essay opens many new ideas to support why exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit. Its starts to make the reader wonder what happened to the planet to make it look the way it does now. Even though it is very dangerous the mission to Venus could posibbly be held to many discorvory's, and this is what the author is telling us he thinks that it is worth it and it definetly is.

Then you get the reader wondering how do we study a planet we can't even land on. The text states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the suface of Venus would allow the scientist to float above the fray."" Then the author compares that to flying above storms in airplanes today. This would allow the humans not to get hurt while testing Venus. The author has given the reader a good way to see how it would be possible for scientis to experiment on Venus. That is another way he makes it seem like a worthy pursuit.

Last of all he makes a point that this step would not just gain insight of the planet, but it will allow us to target bigger task. The text states ""not only because insight gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intiminadating endeavors."" This alows the reader to devolop a sense to what might happen after they experiment on Venus they will start on another dificult task. The author wants the reader to know that this is all in the devolopment in are world. It will alow us to further and that is great for this world to discorver new places.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an amazing job of making sure the reader understand that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit. In the essay he gives us a reason why which is it is the most earth like planet in our solar sytem. Another reason is accomplishing the task of studying venus will allow us to think further and go futher in to are solar system and start discorvering more.

"It is true that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, as it can have a negative impact on the community as a whole. There are a few reasons why this is the case, and some solutions that can be implemented to help encourage young people to become more involved in their communities.

One of the main reasons why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is because of the demands of their studies. In today’s world, students are expected to excel in their studies in order to get into a good college or university. This means that they have to spend a lot of time studying and preparing for tests, leaving them with little time to devote to helping their communities. Additionally, many young people are also working part-time jobs in order to help support their families, leaving them with even less time to volunteer.

Another reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is because of the lack of awareness of the importance of community service. Many young people do not understand the value of helping their communities, and so they do not see the need to do so. This is especially true for those who come from privileged backgrounds, as they may not be aware of the struggles that many people in their communities face.

There are a few solutions that can be implemented to help encourage young people to become more involved in their communities. One solution is to create more opportunities for young people to get involved in community service. Schools and universities can offer courses that focus on community service, and they can also organize volunteer trips and activities for students to participate in. Additionally, organizations such as churches and non-profits can also create volunteer opportunities for young people to get involved in.

Another solution is to create more incentives for young people to get involved in community service. Schools and universities can offer scholarships and awards to students who demonstrate a commitment to helping their communities. Additionally, businesses and organizations can offer discounts and other rewards to young people who volunteer their time.

Finally, it is important to raise awareness about the importance of community service among young people. Schools and universities can organize seminars and workshops that focus on the importance of helping one’s community, and they can also invite speakers to talk about their experiences with community service. Additionally, organizations such as churches and non-profits can also create campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of community service.

In conclusion, it is true that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, as it can have a negative impact on the community as a whole. There are a few solutions that can be implemented to help encourage young people to become more involved in their communities, such as creating more opportunities for young people to get involved in community service, creating more incentives for young people to get involved in community service, and raising awareness about the importance of community service among young people.

"There are pros and cons to both sending electronic cards and sending paper cards for holiday greetings. I believe that, overall, electronic cards are the better option.

First, electronic cards are more environmentally friendly. They do not require any paper, ink, or postage, which means that fewer trees are chopped down and less pollution is created in order to produce and mail paper cards.

Second, electronic cards are more convenient. You can send them to multiple people at once with just a few clicks, and they can be viewed on any device with an internet connection. Paper cards, on the other hand, require you to purchase and mail individual cards, and they can only be viewed on a physical card.

Third, electronic cards are often more personal. You can include animations, music, and even videos in your card, which can make it more special and memorable than a paper card.

Finally, electronic cards are often cheaper. You can usually find free or discounted electronic cards online, while paper cards can be quite expensive, especially if you want to send them overseas.

Overall, I believe that electronic cards are the better option for holiday greetings. They are more environmentally friendly, more convenient, more personal, and often cheaper than paper cards.

"When it comes to community service, many young people believe that they are too busy with their own lives to help others. However, I believe that community service is one of the most important things that young people can do in order to help themselves and their communities.

There are many reasons why community service is important. First and foremost, community service can help young people learn about themselves and what they’re capable of. It can also help them develop important skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. Additionally, community service can provide young people with opportunities to meet new people and make new friends.

Most importantly, community service can make a difference in the lives of others. It can help improve the community in which young people live, and it can also help make the world a better place. By volunteering their time and energy, young people can make a real difference in the world.

In conclusion, I believe that community service is an important activity for young people. It can help them learn about themselves, develop important skills, and make a difference in the world. I encourage all young people to get involved in their community and make a difference in the lives of others.

"Dear, senator

As a student learning more and more about the world we live in I understand that there has been problems deciding weather or not congress should continue to use the electoral college the elect our nationals new or future presidents. I believe that the race for presidency in just a huge game and the electoral college is just a great tool that is used in this game to find a faster way to win. But some people probably don't even know how to use it which is why the problem was arroused.

Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you. Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage.

I believe the electoral chollege should continue to be used and nothing hsould change about how our stong nation selects our leaders because with change comes new obsticals and with those leeps and jumps comes errors. To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining. I think that as a nation these problems are nothing to us, Why creat a big problem out of a simpler problem when we can just let it be and work our way arround the problems we face together.

"Title: The Promising Prospect of Limiting Car Usage

A rigorous examination of various locales worldwide reveals a crucial message: a decrease in car usage can present vast benefits for both individuals and society. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, Bogota in Colombia, and the changing car culture in America, underscore the numerous advantages of reducing car dependency.

The case of Vauban offers significant insights into the potential benefits of a ""car-free"" lifestyle (Rosenthal). The experimental town has yielded positive results, with 70 percent of families straying away from car ownership. This reduction in car use has not only reduced greenhouse gas emissions but also facilitated a more calming and joyful lifestyle, evident when one of the residents remarked that she felt less tension and happier after giving up her car. This example also illustrates that shifting towards public transport and smart planning can be practically accomplished and widely accepted. 

The case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced due to extreme pollution, illustrates the necessary steps that metropolises may have to take to combat environmental issues (Duffer). Interestingly, this bold move drastically reduced congestion by 60%, thus highlighting that limited car usage can contribute to smoother traffic flow and cleaner air. Additionally, the promotion of hybrid vehicles and electric cars over diesel ones demonstrates that alternative transport can mitigate air pollution, hinting at possible actions for other cities with high levels of pollution.

Moreover, the example of Bogota's car-free day conveys how such initiatives can encourage the public to try alternative transportation methods and consequently reduce environmental degradation (Selsky). The success of this event, which other cities have joined in, testifies to the feasibility of minimizing car usage on a larger scale. 

Finally, studies suggest a shift in American culture, with declining car purchases and car usage (Rosenthal). Driving less not only contributes to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions but also potentiates a long-term cultural shift that could transform urban planning and lifestyle choices. 

Each example highlights clear advantages: cleaner atmosphere, reduced traffic, improved lifestyle, and deterrence of climate change. Limiting car usage is undeniably a commendable option for mitigating environmental issues and fostering more sustainable communities. However, it requires collective responsibility and effective policies that facilitate and motivate such changes.

To conclude, the numerous benefits of scaling down car usage make it an option worth considering. It calls for a strategic blend of innovative urban planning, cost-effective public transportation, regulation, and public participation. As society evolves, it is pertinent to prioritize sustainable practices, and limiting car usage represents a crucial element of this path toward sustainability.",1,"tensor([[-0.5896, -0.1876, -0.3755,  ..., -0.2242,  0.4361, -0.3622],

"Do you like to be given multiple good opinions instead of just one? Being given multiple opinions or viewpoints on a situation can be much more helpful than just one. The three reasons multiple opinions are better than just one is: You have more overall brain power and knowledge, a variety of opinions to use to benefit yourself, and the advice you are given may be incorrect, not helpful, or you may not like it; Therefore, having another opinion to lean on can be very useful when a scenario like this occurs.

The first reason I declared why multiple opinions are better is you gain more knowledge about how your peers or even the public views things. For example, just recently baseball season started up again, and I needed a new baseball bat. So, I began browsing online, reading reviews for each bat and seeing what comments or opinions people had about them. I asked my father and some of my teammates for their opinions on which bat to purchase. I asked not just whether the bat was good or bad, but what were some features they liked and some features they disliked about it. Every time I heard someones opinion, I acquired some of the information they told me. Using that I was able to make a smart and thought out decision on which baseball bat I should purchase.

Next, my second reason is talking to more people for their opinion on something means you will have either a mixed variety of opinions or a large number of people with the same opinion on something. Currently, across the world we are experiencing a global health crisis with the rapid spreading of the Coronavirus. Say for instance, you are head of the school board and you have to make a decision for your whole county as to whether or not our schools should be closed or not. The safety of our students, staff, and teachers relies on your decision. If you go around and collect everyone's opinions, you can combine them to come up with the best idea possible. Hearing as many people's opinions as you can and combining them is very beneficial when making decisions.

Lastly, my third and final reason to prove that having multiple people voice their opinions is better than just one is that you may not always find a persons advice helpful. If you ask one person for an opinion on something and you don't find it useful, you have nothing else to help you. On the other hand, if you have collected multiple opinions from multiple people, instead of just one, it doesn't matter if you don't like someones advice. You will still have more pieces of advice or opinions from different people to use for your benefit. That is why when asking for opinions, it is crucial to hear and collect one from multiple people, not just one person.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is very beneficial. Only hearing one opinion is alright, but hearing more than one is only that much better. My three reasons I have this claim are, a persons advice simply might not be helpful to you and having a variety of opinions that you can refer to and use for help is important. My last reason, with hearing more people's opinions you can acquire more knowledge, and in the end, knowledge is key.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1140, -0.1918, -0.4366,  ...,  0.1036,  0.3838,  0.2851],

"As of right now, imagining an automobilefree world may sound crazy, but ambitious goals to end the use of cars has taken place. Suburban and city residents have taken quite a lot of thought into banning driving and giving up their cars, because of the great advantages that go along with these limitations. Reducing the use of cars has amazing advantages in creating a nonpolluted environment, it leads to an increase in exercise, and provides a way to save one's money.

Car reduced communities are being promoted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, swell as all around the world. Paris, France has enforced a driving ban to reduce the intensifying pollution all over the city, as explained in the article entitled, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". If the pattern of banning the use of cars persists, the amount of pollution will be reduced, especially in major big cities, such as Paris, London and Beijing. Continuing this cultural shift ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" ""The End of Car Culture"". Limiting the use of cars would highly advantage and could possibly save our environment, if we conserve our resources correctly.

Hiking, biking, skating andor walking are all types of physical activities that are useful to get from point A to B, rather than using a car. People have began to organize their lives around how they can get to places by exercising, than commuting by car. Restaurants, shopping malls, and work offices are beginning to be located in highly populated areas and within walking range, so that the use of automobiles becomes unecessary. In Bogota, Columbia, people take a carfree day to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. Bogota ""has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" ""Carfree day is spnning into a big hit in Bogota"", in order to encourage citizens to get off the roads with their cars. Exercising has many advantages in limiting car usage, not only creating a nonpolluted planet, but also creating a healthier lifestlye for a person.

As gasoline prices rise, and car insurance rates fly up, less and less people are getting a license and have stopped buying cars to save money. A study done between the years 2001 and 2009 found that driving by young people decreased by twentythree percent, explained in the article, ""The End of Car Culture"". Leasing or owning a car is not a priority for many, as the use of taking public transportation or carpooling is available. Without cars, people are able to save money for important life necessecities, such as food, water, and shelter, where as a car is not something needed and may be considered a luxury in other parts of the world.

Commuting is not imposibble without owning a car. With forms of exercise and public transportation, many are able to get around without spending hundreds of dollars per week on gasoline. Less driving creates a nonpolluted and healthier environment, keeping our planet more stable. Eventhough owning a car seems convenient now, it may not be so convenient in the long run, as we may have to face difficulties that life throws at us. Wasting money on a car gives no advantages, where as a carfree environment is safer and more effective.",0,"tensor([[-0.6824, -0.5163, -0.3664,  ..., -0.3550,  0.7181, -0.1887],

"When I was young, I was born in a small town in Germany. Everything was nice and refreshing, but then I moved to the U.S and I felt uncomfortable. Everthing was big, lots of buildings, and so many cars with their gas polluting this world. I believe that there are lots of advantages of limiting car usages, like a better enviroment, a healthier lifestyle, and a closer walking distance.

Cars have runind many big areas with their smog, like Beijing, China, and Paris,

France.

""Diesel Fuel was blamed...,""

it said in the article,

Paris bans driving due to smog .

If we limited the usage of cars thing like smogs wouldn't happen. Trees won't get ruined from smog and animals wont die from pollution.

The less pollution we have, the more we get helthier. But its not just pollution,

Heidrunu Walter said,

""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way...""

Having no cars and just walking to the palces you need to go or riding a bicycle is so much healthier than driving a car and polluting the world.

In the past two decades there have been efforts to make cities denser, which isn't bad.

That means everything would be walking disitance. there would be stores placed a walk away and not on distant highway. Kids can be safer crossing a walk way and not in danger.

Limitating car usage is not a bad think at all it's rather a very great idea, and way safer. Envioments become healthier, people will have a healthier lifestyle, and everything will become walking distance.",0,"tensor([[-0.0320, -0.0407,  0.0399,  ..., -0.5446,  0.7687,  0.2475],

"The debate about the use of animal testing in medical research has been raging for decades, and there is no clear-cut answer as to whether it should be acceptable or not. On one hand, people argue that animal testing can help save lives by providing new treatments and cures for diseases more quickly than if humans were tested directly, but on the other hand many feel that using animals to test new drugs and procedures is simply wrong. Despite this controversy though, a closer examination of the subject reveals that while there are some negatives associated with animal testing in medical research, the practice should still be allowed due to its potential benefits. First off, it is worth noting that most tests conducted on animals involve very mild procedures such as giving them small doses of medication or performing blood samples rather than anything extreme like surgical operations. This means pain and suffering are minimized even when tests do cause some level of discomfort for animals involved; additionally scientists put substantial effort into ensuring safety protocols are followed closely so any distress caused is minimized wherever possible. With these safeguards in place it becomes apparent then how valuable animal testing can be – potentially saving countless human lives through providing vital data necessary before clinical trials involving humans can begin. For example numerous important vaccines have been developed thanks largely in part due to data collected from experiments with animals which otherwise would never had happened had those tests not taken place at all – proving just how priceless their contributions can be towards furthering our understanding of medicine today. Furthermore an often-overlooked advantage associated with using animals over direct human experimentation lies within cost savings; costs related to running a single experiment on an animal typically works out cheaper than what might have been required if a patient volunteer was used instead (not least because ethical issues surrounding consent would need resolving first). This then provides resources which could better utilized elsewhere perhaps towards improving existing drug therapies already approved or developing entirely new treatments too - ultimately leading us down paths potentially resulting in life-saving breakthroughs quicker than ever before thought possible.

"Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school.

Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out.

Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change.

Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. These are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school.  ",0,"tensor([[-0.1731, -0.3543, -0.3467,  ..., -0.5013,  0.8160,  0.1464],

"""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(source 2). Cars have been a great help to people but now their boarding the line of help and hurt. The advantages of limiting car usage almost never end. There's always a way for you to limit your use of your car. It's great for the plant. Also it brings ease to you. Then last is that it brings people together.

To began with is that it's great for there plant. For example in Bogota, Colombia every year for three years they would have a car free day. That is when everyone would leave their cars at home and use a bike or some alternative transportation to get to were they have to be. If you choose to do the opposite then you would be fined a $25 fee for using your car. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This also happens in Paris, were they banned cars because of smog. Even if the fee was $31 dollar Almost 4,ooo drivers were fined.

In addition to that is that it brings ease to you. Stated in the first source, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter said that. When you don't have to think about any car problem you worry less. Even now there has been a decline in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-old's getting a licenses. It's not a priority anymore. With cars comes worries, and people today don't want any worries.

Last but not last is that it brings people together. Usual when we are driving in our cars we hardly look to see who's driving next to us. But if you take out the cars you can really see wants around you. Meet people while you ride your bicycles. You would see the world in a different way.

In conclusion, limiting cars would benefit you in so many way. One like bringing you closer to the people around you. Also without as many cars it would help the plant. Last it would bring ease to you. Overall the less the cars the better everyone and everything should feel.",0,"tensor([[-1.8973e-01, -3.0416e-01,  1.5463e-01,  ..., -7.8490e-01,

"land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",0,"tensor([[-0.0890, -0.0293, -0.4739,  ..., -0.1668,  0.6904,  0.5131],

"Everyone has at less had one car in there life time no matter how yes it was or how old or ragidy it was it was a car that was poluting our air and giving off greenhouse gas. Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some benefits or advantages you would have if you didn own a car.

We can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what 2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurgents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just lot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pretty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actually forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for 40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurgents,getting your car repairedfixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didn own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. What do you think scards you the most when your dive? Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car.

Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.",0,"tensor([[ 0.3300, -0.0871,  0.4019,  ..., -0.3176,  0.8788, -0.0191],

"There is no single answer to the question of whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It depends on the individual and the circumstances. Some people prefer the structure and convenience of a tour group, while others enjoy the flexibility and spontaneity of travelling on their own.

There are pros and cons to both options. Travelling with a tour guide has many advantages. You have a knowledgeable person to show you around and tell you the history and culture of the places you are visiting. This can be especially helpful if you are unfamiliar with the country or region. A tour guide can also help you with arrangements, such as booking transportation and hotels.

On the other hand, travelling with a tour guide can be restrictive. You may feel like you are on a “bus of tourists”, and are not able to explore the places you visit on your own. Additionally, tour groups can be quite expensive.

Travelling on your own has many advantages. You have the freedom to go wherever you want, when you want. This can be a great way to explore new places and meet new people. You can also save money by cooking your own meals and arranging your own transportation.

However, travelling on your own can also be risky. If you get lost or are in an unfamiliar area, it can be difficult to find help. Additionally, you may not have someone to help you with arrangements, such as booking transportation and hotels.

In conclusion, the best way to travel depends on the individual and the circumstances. Some people prefer the structure and convenience of travelling with a tour guide, while others enjoy the freedom and flexibility of travelling on their own.

"When it comes to the topic of technology and its effect on communication, there is no doubt that our lives have been drastically changed in a positive way by it. From the advent of smartphones, to video chat services like Skype and Facetime, to social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, technology has revolutionized how people keep in touch with one another. While there are some who claim that this digital dialogue has caused us to become more impersonal or less connected than before, I believe these advances in technology actually enable us to remain closer than ever. With just a few clicks of a button or taps on a touchscreen, we can send messages or videos instantly across states and countries without having to physically be in the same place—allowing for meaningful conversations despite physical distance. Additionally, online forums give us opportunities to interact with like-minded individuals from around the world where we can share ideas and experiences through comments posted online. In today's society--where travel opportunities may not be available due to financial reasons or time constraints–technology often becomes our bridge between cultures; connecting us through news stories posted online about political movements happening globally or inspiring TED talks which span various topics including science and business innovations worldwide. In fact, research done by Pew Research Center shows that 66% of Americans now use multiple social media networks—suggesting an increase in interconnectedness within our society thanks largely in part due modern advancements in communications technologies such as instant messaging apps like Whatsapp and Snapchat; internet radio stations; streaming services such as Netflix; location-based sites like Foursquare; even smart appliances!

"The rapid pace of life in the modern era has led to both positive and negative consequences. Some may argue that it has created more problems than it has solved. In my opinion, I agree with this statement because the pace of life today has created several issues that people must deal with.

Firstly, the rapid pace of life has led to an increase in stress levels among individuals. In today's world, people are constantly under pressure to meet deadlines, complete tasks efficiently, and excel in their work fields. This can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, as people may not have time to exercise, eat healthily, or even sleep properly. Living with high levels of stress and anxiety can also lead to mental health issues such as depression, which can ultimately impact an individual's quality of life.

Secondly, technological advancements have made life more efficient but have also created more problems. People are now expected to be connected to their devices, such as smartphones and laptops, 24/7, be it at work or at home. This constant connectivity can lead to an addiction to technology, which can negatively affect social relationships, work productivity, and mental health. Social media, for instance, can lead to people feeling isolated and disconnected from society.

Lastly, the rapid pace of life has led to a decline in interpersonal relationships. People are so busy with their work schedules that they have little time to spend with their family and loved ones. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and even contribute to an increase in divorce rates. In addition, people are more focused on their careers and materialistic possessions than building meaningful relationships with others. This can lead to a lack of empathy and compassion, which can further contribute to a decline in social values.

However, it is also important to note that the rapid pace of life has brought about several positive changes. It has led to technological advancements, medical breakthroughs, and better communication methods. People now have access to information and resources that were once unimaginable. The rapid pace of life has also created more job opportunities and has helped boost the economy.

In conclusion, while the rapid pace of life has brought about several positive changes, it has also created more problems than it has solved. It has led to an increase in stress levels, addiction to technology, a decline in interpersonal relationships, and a lack of social values. Therefore, it is important for individuals to balance their work and personal lives and take the necessary steps to maintain their mental and physical health.

"Ever wondered how the streets of a very populated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole ""carfree"" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.

In Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go carfree. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" Source 1. 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly carfree except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beautiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" source 1. Miami is a carintensive area, I know this from personal experience, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.

Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31"" Source 2. Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Source 2. Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this carfree thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.

""BOGOTA, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3. Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one carfree day, in Bogota called ""Day Without Cars"", this was the third year actually, on this ""carfree"" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Source 3. If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.

In the United States, research shows ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" Source 4. This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Source 4. This means that people aren't as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we'll see more stars in the sky in carintensive areas.",0,"tensor([[-0.1352, -0.1472,  0.5908,  ..., -0.5423,  1.0378, -0.1695],

"While owning a car may seem like the most important possession a person can have, it is becoming more beneficial to find a way to live without them. Cities around the world are turning in their cars, even if just for a day, and finding that it brings plenty of advantages to make up for what could be seen by some as a troublesome lack of easy transportation. Both the environment and and the well being of the people are grateful for the new change, and examples of such will follow.

To begin, according to ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one can learn about Vauban, Germany, a place manifested so that residents of the upscale community must give up their cars. While residents are still permitted to own cars, they must be kept in large garages at the edges of the community. Here, the owner of the car must buy a space within the garage, along with a home in the residence. Parking on the streets is forbidden, along with driveways and home garages. The streets of the residency are completely free of cars, except for a few streets on one side of the community, and for where the tram to downtown runs through. Most of the citizens of Vauban choose not to own a car, or sold their car in order to move to the community, and find they are much more content in their lifestyle because of it. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, stated that she is ""much happier this way"", explaining that she was always tense while in possession of a car. This community was created as a prime example to showcase the advantages of limited or forbidden car usage, and it is now being used as the basis of the growing trend around the world, including America and more places in Europe, in which suburban life is being separated from its former dependence on auto use.

Furthermore, the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage. After suffering through days of nearrecord pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a carfree day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Carfree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with 25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

In addition, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal tells the reader of the new goals created to cut down on America's greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, the goals, set by President Obama, have been graciously aided by recent studies which show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and have been making less of an effort to get a license as the years go by. With transportation being the second largest source of the nation's carbon emissions, behind power plants, this pattern, if maintained, will most likely have majorly benificial impacts on the environment.

All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.",0,"tensor([[-0.1362, -0.1611, -0.2249,  ..., -0.3601,  0.3020,  0.1677],

"I believe that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of.

There are many reasons why I believe this to be the case. For one, plastic bags are not biodegradable and take up a lot of space in landfill. Secondly, they are often difficult to recycle, meaning that a lot of them end up in the environment in a unusable form. And finally, they are often used only once and then disposed of, which means that they are contributing to the problem of litter.

All of these factors together mean that we are creating a lot of waste that we cannot easily dispose of. If we want to keep our environment clean and healthy, we need to start thinking about ways to reduce our reliance on plastic bags and other disposable items.

"The author uses connotations by suggesting that venus is a worthy pursuit is studying but the dangers that it has is that it's the hottest planet in the solar system and went through the greenhouse effect while is was being created. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets around it. The temperatures on average is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has more powerful earthquakes,erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes.

It says that NASA is working on approaches for getting to venus. Like for example,simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested through a chamber. A vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the ground but the surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Venus can sometimes be a good planetary visit. The planet has rocky sediments on its surface such as valleys,mountains and craters.

A phone or a tablet being exposed to acid could be heat capable to melting just imagine what that would be like. By comparing it with a system that uses mechanical parts the system can be made to be more resistant from pressure and heat resources. Many researchers cannot take gas or rock from a distance.

"""I would identify you playing an online game such as cahoot, coolmath, and theres lot of other games you could play online that will help you learn something. The thing is the games are fun to play and are educational. Examples would be Cahoot is this game where you and your classmates play the teacher gives questions and whoever gets the most right wins at the end of the game sometimes the Teacher might give you a reward for winning. There is also coolmath it's not one particular game but its a website with tons and tons of games you can play math games there really fun.

The games are fun because you get to play with your friends and specially on cool math there is this one game where your a cube and you have to run and theres levels it helps you with geometry. ""I would say lots of people that go to public schools have played that game because it's just that popular and fun. Especially cahoot every kid that attends a public school has played this game either to study or just have some free time.

""Im not just saying you have to play games to have fun while being educational but it does really help a person out some kids would just rather maybe get a book or do the work straight up and thats also good but sometimes you could enjoy playing games and those games are enjoyable and help you learn to ""I really suggest them. But there are other things like doing a science experiment you could find interesting things that you never knew before, also playing an instrument ""if you enjoy music thats really fun you can learn how to play a instrument,You could also be in a play if you like acting anything that fits your interest and is educational you should try it.

"" I also identified math , chest , and science fairs. First we will talk about Math , when your good at math and want to compete against other students or just learn more and be good at math there usually pretty fun when you finally get to know all that stuff its a great experience.

""Now we will talk about chest , chest itself is a really fun board game you have to use your brain to make good plays and focus on what your doing why its fun is when you become good at the game or already are it gets easy and enjoyable. You can win money from chest if your competing for your school or maybe a team they have tournaments and you can win money which is great because everyone wants some type of money.

"Many technological improvements in the field of education are being made every day. There are constantly new and exciting ways to educate and teach students each and every year. However, behind all of that technology there must still be a competent teacher/instructor there in order to fully teach the material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not valuable because it lets teachers not engage as much with students, is not necessary for a successful learning environment, and would be too complicated and powerful for most computers to be realistically implemented throughout the country.

While technology can definitely assist in giving students a worthwhile academic experience, there still must be a competent and engaged teacher past it in order for students to truly learn. With more and more advancements being made, it gives teachers and instructors less and less responsibility and obligation to teach properly and effectively. While some may argue that a human instructor is not necessary for students to learn, it is still more beneficial for a fellow human being to convey the lessons being taught alongside the technology than just the technology teaching. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the technology states ""''...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote shows that this technology could essentially take over a lot of aspects of a teacher's job, giving the teacher less of an obligation to teach their students. Human instructors are important for people to learn material effectively, so they must be given a certain amount of responsibility in order for there to be a good learning environment.

While this technology could theoretically be beneficial for students, it is not an essential aspect needed for a successful learning environment. The article talks about how this technology can assess people's emotions similarly to how people do in person everyday. In the article, the doctor who helped develop the software says ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" This could be a helpful tool in certain scenarios, but as the article mentions, humans do this process naturally throughout the day and while we cannot assess as accurately as a computer could, we can still sense the general emotion of someone. This makes the face analyzing technology a possibly beneficial tool, but an unnecessary and unrealistic tool as well.

Even if this technology were an absolutely essential part of every classroom, at this point in time it is not realistic to expect it to be implemented effectively. This software is relatively new and is powerful, so an expensive and powerful computer must be used in order to utilize it well. In the article, the author states that ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile."" This quote implies that most PC's currently available to people would not be capable of using the software. Even if most schools could acquire the powerful computers needed to run this software, it would take a serious and detrimental chunk of funding away from other more important school aspects such as lunches or libraries. Even though the techonology can be helpful in certain instances, it is not realistic to expect schools to be able to implement it anytime soon.

The Facial Action Coding System is a promising new technology, and as such has it's fair share of issues. While seemingly impressive and futuristic at first glace, once one begins to take into account other factors the system starts to become more of an interesting novelty than a breaking new education tool to be used in classrooms across the globe. New developments often bring improvement with them, but before being implemented must be tweaked and carefully considered in order to be successful. In around a decade, this facial reading software could be a typical sight in many classrooms. But as it stands now, it has too many flaws and issues in order to be taken seriously.",0,"tensor([[-0.1310, -0.2304, -0.2157,  ..., -0.2326,  0.2601,  0.2000],

"Many schools have partnerships with local companies. It allow students to explore certain professions. Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success.

Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed.

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesn't work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, It's as hard as touching the clouds. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I won't like to take all the risk by myself. I don't want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. I would love to work with other people when I grow up.

Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. It's not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. Sharing money to grow the business. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness.

Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and it's the most important thing in a partnership business.

A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and

"Phones and Driving

The use of phones has grown tremendously to the point that people feel as if they can't survive without them. It's bad to know that our phones are becoming more and more of our lives and that people can't take their attention off of them for minutes while they are on the road. I personally don't think people should be able to use phones while driving because it delays everything as in the way people drive how they are at stop lights and all of that. Many bad things have come from people driving and texting so I dont think it should happen that people can excess phones while driving.

There are many delays when people are on their phones. If they drive you can pretty much tell if they are on them because, it will show they will sit at the stop light longer even after the light turns green and they drive slower. You have to remember to when you are driving like this it puts others at risk of kids if they are playing and you don't see them because you are on the phone it will put them at danger if you do something. A lot of drivers that do this don't think of it as a risk because it benefits them but it truly is because, its putting every one in danger including them because their attention is altered and the person in front of them may make a sudden change.

I was looking at a document and it said that texting and driving is comparable to drinking under the influence if not worse and I could see that because when they are on the phone they swerve and slow down and their attention isn't on the road at all. People who are texting while driving are 23% more likely to crash their cars. This percentage is equivalent to that of the average person who has drunk four beers and then began to operate a car which is scary because, I am on the road pretty much everyday and to know that these people are out there too is terrible. If phones are worse than drinking I feel that it should be illegal to be on your phone while driving because, it is illegal to drink and drive so this should be too.

In conclusion, I don't agree with being on your phone while driving is right and it should be banned. A lot of bad outcomes can come from a person being on their phone. It's very sad to think about what could happen. People have kids and still drive with them for example my cousin does it and it's sad that she can put her selfish needs to the side for one minute to focus on the road so her and her baby can get to where they need to go safely. My mom always says I think about myself and others which is good because I always analyze everything for everyone and I want everyone to be good so if I need to get off my phone for a few mins for a safer drive I am fine with that.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1549, -0.2837,  0.1581,  ..., -0.7462,  0.4517, -0.2799],

"""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" Heidrun Walter said in the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars', in the New York Times, ""I'm much happier this way."" In Vauban, Germany, people do not use cars. They find other means of transportation, such as biking and walking. In Bogota, the construction of bicycle paths has made 118 miles of passages for residents. According to David Goldberg, ""All our development since World War II has been centered around the car."" While that is not entirely true, it does have a good point. We should move on from the all-powerful box with wheels.

One major reason for not using cars is pollution. As most of us know, pollution is bad for the environment, and for most life on Earth. Unfortunately, our use of cars and power plants is generating pollution faster then plants can take it out of the atmosphere. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"", Elisabeth Rosenthal said. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", 60% of drivers in Paris stopped after five days of intensifying smog. That means that the smog was dense enough to where it was dangerous for drivers to go anywhere.

The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" mentions that: ""The turnout [for car-free day] was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" Why would people continue to participate in car-free day if they hated it so much? Despite the fine of $25, it really isn't a big deal. One of the participants, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Now, how can you simply stop driving? You need to get to your job! Nobody is telling you to move to Vauban. However, biking or walking to the park could help. You don't need a car to go to your neighbor's house. They're right next door. Of course, not using cars is not going to stop the pollution from power plants, but it will certainly slow down how fast it is going into the atmosphere.

We simply can't allow pollution to go where it is going. If we all stop relying on cars to get us to places, we will have enough time to think of an easier solution. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. There is a chance that being car-free won't be as bad as everyone thinks. It might even be enjoyable. There is also a chance that it will despised. We'll only know if we try it, now won't we?",0,"tensor([[-0.2034, -0.3565, -0.0179,  ..., -0.1733,  0.7381, -0.0562],

"I think it's good to know people's opinion because it can help you deside on something you wanna do. Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item. If you wanna buy something first it's good to talk to someone who has bought the item they can tell you if it works or not. Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesn't work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if it's bad for you.

And you have to talk to more then just one person to be sure because if you don't you can waste you money just like that. And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they aren't saying things right they are just trying to help you. It's always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they aren't sure if they wanna buy the item or not. If you care about a person your going to give your advice to a person because they are some how confused on something you can help them. Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesn't work they are just going to waste money on the item.

Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesn't work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting.

"Many people wonder whether or not cars should be ban to help save the environment. They dont know if that would help us or make matters worse. Their are many advantages to not using cars. Some people just can't seem to let go of their cars. They need a push to get started and to stop using their cars every single day.

Their are multiple advantages to the banning of cars. One example would be getting rid of air pollution. Most air pollution is caused by cars so if you get rid of cars you will also get rid of air pollution. Air pollution can cause a lot of different problems it can cause people to get sick or many other things, so getting rid of it completely could help a lot of people.

Another thing people wouldn't have to worry about would be traffic jams on the way to work. During the week some many people are trying to get to and from work at the same time it causes a traffic jam. People are often late to work because of this reason. So putting a ban on cars could help out with that. People could walk to and from work or ride a bike. This would limit the number of traffic jams and people wouldn't have to worry about being late to work.

If people walked everywhere instead of drove everywhere people would be getting a lot of exercise and that could help too. Cars make us seem lazy where we drive everywhere we want to go but if we walk or rode a bike that could help out in many ways. Walking could get things off your mind you could walk with a friend that way you can hangout and talk about things while you walk. Walking could relieve stress. It could calm you down and just make you relax for a few and forget about all your problems.

Putting a ban on cars could also help the town in which you live in, not only by limiting air pollution but it could boost town activity. New restaurants would be built, and more places to shop. People would spend money on other things besides gas for their cars. Town businesses would do better and make more money, also new businesses could form.

Also getting rid of cars could limit the amount of deaths every year. Many deaths every year come from car accidents, drunk drivers, people not paying attention and many other things. If everyone walked or rode bikes to the places they wanted to go that could get rid of many deaths that happen every single day. That would make the world safer in so many ways.

Getting rid of cars and not depending on cars for everything could be what this worlds needs to improve itself. This could take us one step closer to living longer, happier, and healthy lives. People wouldn't have to worry about getting a car or paying insurance on a car. People wouldn't have to worry about getting their kids license, teaching them how to drive or anything like that. The number of deaths each year could go down and things could change for the better.",0,"tensor([[ 0.3347, -0.2983, -0.0854,  ..., -0.6468,  0.8111, -0.1800],

"The history of mathematics is an interesting and complex one, spanning centuries of development. From its ancient origins in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China to the modern day theories that underlie our technological advancements, mathematics has been a pillar in understanding both physical reality and abstract concepts. Studying the history of mathematics can provide insight into how humans have constructed their beliefs about the natural world through symbolic reasoning. The earliest mathematical discoveries date back over 4500 years ago to Ancient Egypt where Archeologists found evidence of a primitive form of arithmetic called “Hieratic” which was used for measuring land area, taxation purposes, and creating calendars. The Babylonians developed algebraic equations around 1700 BCE while Ancient Greece made advances in geometry with works by Euclid such as Elements which still serves as a foundational text today. In 400 CE Indian mathematician Brahmagupta created fractions and solved quadratic equations while Diophantus wrote Arithmetica- a collection on solving algebraic equations using only numbers. During the Renaissance period there were several important figures who revolutionized mathematical thought; most notably Galileo Galilei who rejected Aristotelian logic declaring instead that knowledge could be gained through observation and experimentation leading to new techniques being applied to math such as Calculus from Sir Isaac Newton & Gottfried Leibniz in 1687. This allowed scientists to calculate more accurately situations involving velocity or acceleration moving away from Aristotle’s qualitative approach towards more quantitative modes like statistics & probability theory developed by Blaise Pascal & Pierre de Fermat respectively during this time period too!. In modern times Mathematics has become increasingly specialized allowing mathematicians access into new fields previously not available due to limitations set out by previous generations lack of technology or conceptual innovation; from Chaos Theory providing insight on randomness & unpredictability inherent within nature itself all way up till Biomathematics where we see applications related specifically towards biology or medicine (ie: modelling disease spread).

"Dear Senate , it is evident that many people think electoral voting is the wrong thing to do. I think that we sould use another method of voting like popular voting. I feel this way because the president that you might be voting for might win the popular vote but because he had lost the electoral vote he doesnt become president. I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president , and because I think its wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.

Although electoral voting may seem good its not because you dont really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have . In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" it state that ""Under the electoralcollege system , voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldnt be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. also in source 2 it states "" The single bets argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This just show how bad electoral voting can get . So we need to change the way of voting before it gets out of hand.

After reading the passage I see another problem that electoral voting causes , which is that electoral voting is unfair to the people of the united states. It states ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" this just explaing that candidate that know that they cannot win your states votes wont even bother to try.

People might feel that electoral voting is the best way to vote because we've always used it, and because it restores some balance that me be needed with larger states. But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problem for us in the past and how dont we know it will not cause them in the future. that why we should change our way of voting.

Electoral voting is a bad method of voting because it is unfair to people, most of the time your not even voting for the candidate you want, and because its like of vote don't count on whether or not we get the president that we would like.",0,"tensor([[-0.3705, -0.1554, -0.4302,  ..., -0.5680,  0.2381,  0.4069],

"The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.

One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.

Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.

In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.

Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa.

When you have a opportunity take that because that is your like, Try to have a new opportunity and get that before other person have the same carrier not keep your goal because if that person get first that carrier your life change because you said my carrier stop here because other person won the job first them me,like in my life I have a job but in times is so burn and them said I one to change my job a other more better because not pay me the enough to work their like the all week I work 5 days the that 5 days I work 4 days for my self and is not to easy to clean everything for my self I took with my boss to find a another employed, but she said no because this mouths is not business and thats why she no can to find a another employed to help me, to this point I failure because a not won enough money to help at my mom like pay the rent or help and another object.

"The Electoral College

Dear Mr. Nixon

I think as a citizen of Flordia that the Electoral College should not be apart of our states voting rights because the people voteing do not have a direct vote to the president. Our state just like many others have a ""Winner-takes-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" Every election is a unfair election because the people dont get to directly vote for the president.

""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" This is proof that not only basic people of the USA think the electoral college should not exit but people who have been important to this country and other commities.

When voting through the electoral college voters dont vote for the president they vote for a slate of eloctors who then elect the president. Which is not right to the people who do vote an the people running for president, plus its wrong to the country because everyone has the right as a US citizen to elect a president but there not actually voting for the president.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" This is again more proof that the elecooral college is unfair to all the U.S voters.

""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college."" The electoral college is something that should be taken out of the electing process because it dosent give us as U.S citizens our exact rights to vote for president because its the electors who elect the president not the people.",0,"tensor([[-0.6409,  0.1421, -0.3581,  ..., -0.5490,  0.7575,  0.6197],

"I think we choose our character traits and we are influenced beyond our control. I say both because sometimes we choose to be who we are without nobody telling us what to do, what to say and not forcing us to do something we don't want to do. Choosing our character traits can be something hard for some people, because some of us think that we are going to be judged by other people and some of us think that we are not going to get accepted for who we are. Me I do both sometimes I choose my character traits and sometimes i'm influenced by other people, I don't think its good to be influenced by other people because I think we should be the one's controlling our character traits at all times. But sometimes we feel forced to do something we don't wanna do or say and it's not part of our character, But we feel we have to because there maybe someone watching or it could just be pure pressure, Doing stuff we don't always do that is basically getting influenced by other people because we are doing something that we don't really want to do. This is why I say it's both we choose and we are influence.

I think you don't really choose if you control your traits or not, because some days you can be yourself and other days your kinda getting controlled, because you do what people are telling you what to do and basically your not yourself your not doing what you want to do your listing to other people. I really think theres no option I think everyone does both, one day they are themselves and some days they are not themselves because there not doing what they want to do, there kinda getting controlled in some type of way.

In conclusion I think every one does both they choose or sometimes they don't, Honestly I think everyone should be themselves and not let anyone control them. Everybody in this world should choose there own character traits but it doesnt happen because we all sometimes feel that we get influenced by some other people, Basically what i'm trying to say is be yourself and don't be someone your not.

"Dear Senator, The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Paragraph 11 Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Paragraph 1 by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media available, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Paragraph 9 Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Paragraph 13 This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" Paragraph 20 Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smallerimpact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""

"Do you want to elect the president? The electoral college doesn't allow that unless you're an elector. Voting for president should be done with a popular vote rather than an electoral college. An electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

An electoral college is unfair. In source two, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This shows that candidates don't treat everyone the same. They spend more time in states that have a chance of winning. Some states never even get to see who the candidates are.

Not only are electoral colleges unfair, they're also outdated. The electoral college has been being used since 1960. In source two, it says, "" It happened in Hawaii in 1960."" This proves that the electoral college has been around for many years, and it's time for something new. Things change along with time, a new system would improve voting.

The electoral college is irrational. In an electoral college, you don't vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This proves that the system doesn't make sense and citizens should be able to directly vote for the president of their country.

Thomas Jefferson believed that the key to getting tasks done was to strike a balance between constant work and rest. Taking time to rest was vital in order to refresh memories, perfect ideas, and help alleviate the temptation of overthinking small matters. By ensuring that one is taking the time to rest, it is easier to tackle tasks with the appropriate frame of mind and boost efficiency. As Jefferson once said, ""Never take more time and pains than is necessary for a thing - the genuine wisdom is in taking the shortest way.""

"People shouldn't be able to use phone while they're driving, but at the same time people need their phone in case of an emergency. Or if their job requires using their phone and driving at the same time they'll have to use their phone.

Everyone knows the law that says that you can't use your phone while driving. Some of the reasons law enforcement say that is because they're plenty of incidents like car accidents or someone getting hit or running a red life. Those reasons could put your life or someone else's life at risk. If you need to use your phone, mostly for emergency purposes, you should pull over on the side of the road and their will me no lives at risk. Many people in the world, including teens, have been badly injured or killed from accidents because either them or the other driver were using their phone.

On the other hand some people in the world are going to have to use their phones as a job. For example, ubers and lyfts. People that do that as a job are going to have to use their phones to use their GPS to find the person that they are picking up from there location. But that goes for anybody that is traveling to places that they haven't heard of before or haven't been there in a while and forgot their ways on how to get there.

People should be able to use their phones while their driving, but at the same time they should not be able to use their phone at all. So what the law enforcements should do is that they should event some type of bumper sticker that people could put on their cars so that they should use their phone for certain purposes only. That should help the driving more safe at least. That should cause less accidents in the world. The only way to get those bumper stickers is that you have to have a job that requires you to use your phone. You're going to have to show proof that you are doing that job.

"Imagine you are in school and you had to sit an a room with four wall. Moreover, you had a frustrating day because of teachers, students and school work. And then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour. How would you feel after all of that? Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body. An addition, when students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside. Which is a unfair for students and it's bad for the students safety.

Next, students will not have time to spend with there family members nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do. Neither will teacher have time to spend with there kids, since they have test to grad and paper work. In the same token, students would not be motive to play or have fun because all they would think about is school. Beside, the students will not have a lot of time to sleep.

Furthermore, one day the students will not have the energy to go to school. Similarly, they will become depressed and have a negative mood. And the students might not even want to come to school any more. Which put the students in a high risk.

In conclusion, The school board should not add one and half to the school hours. Students will not function well, since there is more class time which means more class work. Additionally, some students have sports and many things to do after school. However, when the students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside which is bad for the students safety.

Having the courage to step outside of one's comfort zone and venture into the unknown can be terrifying and intimidating. But it can also be incredibly rewarding. However, going too far beyond our existing knowledge can be overwhelming, leading to more difficulty in achieving our goals. While pushing boundaries is important for growth, sometimes we can learn more by staying within our capability and experimenting from there.

Taking on something we know can help build confidence and hone our abilities in areas we are already familiar with. This may involve perfecting an existing skill—becoming a virtuoso on the guitar, for example—or just exploring all the possibilities that already exist with the tools we already possess. Working within the realms of one's comfort zone can also help jog creative juices, allowing us to come up with new ideas and perspectives we may not have seen before. 

Ultimately, whether we're trying something new or mastering the things we already know, both enable us to progress. It is important to ensure that we are constantly learning, whether that involves taking on something completely unfamiliar or not. Each journey, big or small, can help us to move forward, even if we choose to stay close to home.",1,"tensor([[ 0.2284, -0.2776, -0.5305,  ..., -0.0415,  0.0618,  0.1304],

"It is increasingly true that obtaining a graduate degree is necessary for professional advancement. While this trend may have some drawbacks, I believe that it ultimately benefits society as a whole.

One potential downside of this phenomenon is that it may lead young people astray. They may believe that a degree is a guarantee of success, and not devote enough effort to developing other essential skills. However, I think this is a relatively minor concern. For the most part, people are intelligent enough to realize that a degree is not the only factor that determines success.

Another potential downside is that obtaining a graduate degree can be expensive. This can place a heavy financial burden on young people and their families. However, I believe that the benefits of a graduate degree outweigh the costs.

Some of the benefits of obtaining a graduate degree include higher salaries, greater job security, and more opportunities for advancement. In addition, a graduate degree demonstrates an individual's commitment to learning and self-improvement. This can be important in a competitive job market.

Ultimately, I believe that the trend of obtaining graduate degrees is a positive one. It benefits society as a whole by promoting education and helping to create a more skilled workforce.

"I disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. Another example is if Generic_Name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school.

The second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. An example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. Another example is if Generic_Name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. Another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything.

Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. Another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. Another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. Another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be. Another reason there shouldnt be one hour and a half is that everyone has their schedules like for example shower,homework,eat,sleep and they wont have time to do all of their schedule

"It is said that time heals all wounds, but this may not be the case when it comes to dealing with the emotional scars of losing a loved one. Grieving for someone who has passed away is an incredibly difficult process that can leave long-lasting effects on those affected. Unfortunately, there is no magic solution or timeline for getting over such a loss; rather, each person must find ways to cope and move forward in their own unique way and in their own time. The stages of grief experienced after death can vary from individual to individual as well as depending on how close the relationship was between the deceased and griever. Commonly accepted stages include denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—though others may also experience additional phases like guilt or relief. While these feelings are normal and expected reactions during mourning periods they should not be ignored or repressed; instead it’s important to acknowledge them so they can eventually be dealt with in healthy ways like talking through issues with family members or other trusted individuals in your life or seeking professional counseling if needed. Although healing takes time there are some things you can do to help yourself cope better while going through this process: allowing yourself permission to feel whatever emotion comes up without judgment; expressing sadness openly via crying (or other outlets) instead of bottling up emotions internally; engaging in enjoyable activities either alone or with friends/family members (even just going for walks outside); reaching out for comfort from those around you; turning towards spiritual practices if applicable (e.g., prayer); journaling about thoughts/feelings surrounding loss; finding new hobbies related to something your loved one enjoyed doing before passing away—allowing you both closure and remembrance at once—and lastly understanding that it's ok (and even necessary) sometimes just take “time out” from trying too hard during tough moments until feeling ready again soon afterward. . . In conclusion grieving after death of a loved one requires patience

"Venus, Earth's ""twin"" sister is a extordinary planet that may have been the most earth like planet in our solar system according to paragraph 4. It is also stated that Venus may have probably been covered largely with oceans that could support all form of life. Due to the dense atmosphere and toasty temperatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. It has been impossiple to let alone land on venus but even taking samples of Venus's rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Many drones have been sent there to gather information about Venus according to paragraph 2. Each mission to land on Venus has ben unmanned due to the problem of no spacecraft not being able to survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even with all these issues with venus, stated in paragraph 7. NASA is still working on other approaches to studying Venus because again it is a extordinary planet that is said to have been suitible for all forms of life. Finding out what happend to make Venus be in the state it is right now would help the human race from stopping Earth from becoming like Venus. There has been many ideas to get a view on venus ground conditions such as peering from a orbiting ship but that would only give a limited insight due to the dense atmosphere. On paragraph 6 it is stated ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". That just goes to show you how landing on Venus or even getting the smallest bit of sample of it is a worthy pursit despite the risks and dangers of it. The curiosity of the human race is a powerful thing, Even though Venus is described as a dangerous planet. One day we will figure out the secrets Venus hold and perhaps even have a human land on the surface as well, until then we will just keep on working on more innovations that will one day allow us to get the insight of Venus.",0,"tensor([[-0.3112, -0.2311,  0.1849,  ..., -0.0626,  1.2177, -0.0296],

Another detail from paragraph 2 they state only because it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh.

In the Paragraph 3 it states ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" Which means that it's just a illusion it wasn't acutually seen or proven to be a human head.

In paragraph 9 garvin who is in the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft he states ""It's not easy to targey cydonia."" which means that they just can fly over cydonia and spot it right away.

"Throughout the article author, Nick D'Alto, meets Dr. Huang who has created a way to recognize someones real emotions through technonlgy and a computer system that could help people read emotions of students in a class room. The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang he uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole class room full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

If teachers and other students knew how a whole class room of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day everyday. Most people like to keep their emotions privite, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Yet humans are not experts so to us, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" (D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, ""the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So if a class room of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much more happier.

Concluding, that this tecnological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everwhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and predend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. If a student in the class room was pretending to be okay, and then stood infront of the computure to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by obseving a mouth being streached sideways using the zygomatic major and risorius revealing the student isn't actually happy. With the help of Science and Dr. Huang it could reveal so much more about the real emotions in someone elses life that no one ever knew about.",0,"tensor([[-1.7681e-01, -2.5385e-01,  5.5902e-04,  ..., -1.9007e-01,

"There has beeon a major awareoness of the effects that cars have oon us as a meaons of traonsportatioon. People questioon whether or onot abaondooniong cars as our primary use of traonsportatioon is worth the health of the eonviroonmeont. The simple aonswer to that is obvious, there would be ono awareoness, ono statistics, ono movemeonts to preveont the use of cars, if there wereon't aony issue with them. Elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is almost impossible, meaoniong that the solutioon to this fossil fuel emissioon problem must be aon alteronative source of eonergy. As techonology has advaonced, so has the miondset the majority of the moderon society's populatioon towards the issues of cars. Has the miondset of the populatioon surpassed the advaoncemeont of techonology, or have we beeon igonoriong the fact that these fossil fuels emissioons have beeon detrimeontal to our eonviroonmeont.

The oone major thiong that has caught everyoone's atteontioon is that the health of our eonviroonmeont beiong onegatively impacted by the use of cars everyday. This is because this is the problem that should catch everyoone's atteontioon. People have this false onotioon that we woont see aony eonviroonmeontal chaonges ion our lifetime, so this meaons we doont have to worry about this onow. The problems that we predicted would occur have beeon occurriong over the past few years. A prime example of this would be ion Paris. Paris had beeon experieonciong some weather problems. There was aon abuondaonce of smog that was filliong the air, aond diesel fuel was blamed. Paris eonforced a partial driviong baon as a solutioon to the smog problem. By elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon, some questioons may occur. How will exteronal delivery compaonies be able to deliver. By onot beiong able to deliver, these compaonies will lose reveonue, due to the fact that Paris has a partial baon oon driviong. Sionce this is most likely temporary, aond a ""partial"" baon, this problem may be elimionated from the coons list of implemeontiong this regulatioon. But a correlatioon occurred. After the partial baon of driviong, the smog disappeared. This shows that by elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon this would have a sigonificaont effect oon our harmed eonviroonmeont.

Aonother fallacy that the majority of the populatioon has is that the oonly problem faciong the use of cars as the moderon society's primary source of traonsportatioon is that cars harm the eonviroonmeont. Eveon though this is the problem that we all oneed to face onow, there are other tedious thiongs that come with the adoptioon of cars. Bogota, Columbia, has had extreme coongestioon, has created a movemeont that has beeon so successful it has spread to other couontries. This movemeont ionvolves the populatioon abaondooniong their cars for oone day aond usiong aony other possible meaons of traonsportatioon. This movemeont eoncourages the elimionatioon of cars, physical fitoness, aond the elimionatioon of traffic jams. The populatioon of Bogota is so dedicated to this movemeont, that they have participated on this movemeont through bad weather coonditioons. This movemeont treats itself like a fuondameontal holiday to have every year. ""It' s a good oppurtuonity to take away stress aond lower air pollutioon."" Carlos Arturo Plaza participaont of the movemeont.

As you caon see the process of elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is a very difficult thiong to accomplish. Bogota, Columbia's movemeont to abaondoon cars for oone day is the closest the moderon society has gotteon to this. For this reasoon, there should be aon alteronate source of eonergy cars should ruon off of. By the eonviroonmeontal issues faciong the use of cars, there have beeon maony other problems that have sprouted because of the awareoness that the moderon society's citizeon has onow. Through the support of cars as the primary source of the moderon populatioon's traonsportatioon, there has beeon aon abuondaonce of users of cars. Sionce there was aon overproductioons of cars, seeiong how this is the primary source of traonspotatioon, statistics have occurred showiong the true daongers of the effects that the overuse of cars has oon our eonviroonmeont. By implemetiong aon alteronate source of eonergy that is onot harmful to the eonviroonmeont, this would fix the majority of the problems. Ionstead we have beeon focusiong oon selfdriviong cars ionstead of cars that will be able to sustsaion our eonviroonmeont before it's too late.

Based on what i read i think that limiting car usage is a great idea. Two reasons why i think its a good idea also is because it will help our envieroment and less accidents and deaths . Now its possible that some countrys already have no cars period but we may need some cars and any type of vehicle because we need some kind of transportation because we can't always walk it will eventually hurt us to walk always. Like it says in source 1 paragraph 2 in vaubans streets its completly car free that means that there most be no accidents at all amd less traffic for them. Here in florida we have many vehicles and need them but it would be something different to not have them and maybe have less accidents and help our enviroment too because if u think about it we sometimes leave our cars turned on and that destroys the enviroment that we live in . I myself prefer to have vehicles because its better because its resourcefull and easier to travel.,0,"tensor([[ 0.1144, -0.0875,  0.5932,  ..., -0.7472,  0.6240,  0.1461],

"There are pros and cons to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. On the one hand, having a tour guide can be very helpful. They can provide you with information about the places you are visiting and help you avoid getting lost. They can also help you find the best places to eat and shop. On the other hand, tour guides can be expensive, and they can be inflexible. If you want to do something that is not on the tour, you may have to pay extra.

I think that the best way to travel depends on the person. Some people like to have everything planned out for them, and a tour guide can be a great way to do that. Other people prefer to be more spontaneous, and they may not want to be tied down to a tour guide. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what is best for them.

"When you are seeking for advice, why do you often find yourself asking multiple people for their opinions? What is so beneficial about asking multiple people for their opinions on a topic they may not know much about? How does it help you make a better choice? I can answer that question for you.

When seeking for advice is can be about anything, family, friends or just general decision making. Let's come up with an example, Generic_Name was friends with a group of kids since childhood, she starts to lose touch with them and realizes how much she needed them in her life but she doesn't know how to approach them or talk to them anymore. she decides to ask her older brother for advice, he tells her that she shouldn't even try but if she really wanted to then she should

""just be straight up with them"". Her brother only says this because he dislikes some of Generic_Name's friends and finds them annoying. She doesn't really like that idea so she decides to ask someone else for their opinion. The way everyone problem solves and views things is different, not everyone has the same mindset which is why its important to hear multiple point of views.

When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way. Hearing many different sides can help you come to a better conclusion of your own because you can then weigh out the pros and cons of your situation. Everyone's point of view will be different like that of your 13 year old friend who is your age and knows you very personally or of your 72 year old grandmother. Your friend may know you well but your grandmother has lived longer as has possibly experienced the same things you are currently experiencing. Each has its own benefit and can help add onto your thought process.

You make better choices when you have the opportunity to properly think things through. In order to do that you have to give your self time. When talking to different people you are forcibly giving your self that time to process and think about what your next move will be. This gives you a clearer mind and opens up a better way of seeing things. After that like I have stated before, you can use other peoples opinions to build off of your own. It also imperative to look at all angles of your situation because you may not being seeing important factors that can help you problem solve that someone else may see.

In conclusion, there are many reasons as to why should always ask more than one person when seeking for advice on an issue. Not only will you be building your knowledge on how to deal with those kind of situations but you are also learning how to put together ideas to form your own. Asking multiple people will push you to think more and create a well thought out plan. You also learn not rely on one specific person just in case their opinion is bias when it comes to a certain topic. That is why I believe that seeking advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0926, -0.6301, -0.3429,  ...,  0.0201,  0.5016,  0.1072],

"Dear State Senator,

How do you feel about the Electoral College? Do you think that we should still keep the Electoral College or should it be changed by election of popular vote for the president of the United States? From my side I think that we should keep the Electoral College. There are my reasons that conviced me to say this because we have use it for many years now. How is it that you can vote without the Electoral College?

The first reason why I think we should keep the Electoral College is be cause it is not a place, it is a process. So how can this hurt other people to not want this if you can't find it? This process is a very smart thing that the founding fathers established because it is fare to everyone. It is fare because it is a voting decision that the electors elected as President and Vice President. To me making an election is the best way to make a decision so that everyone wont be angry at each other.

The Electoral College is a voting system. Voting is the one of the best ways to pick out things that everyone has a different opinion. For example, evey four years there is an elective going on for who can become president of The United States Of America. This system will allow everyone in the United States to vote who should be the next president. The same thing goes for the governments of each state and county.

When we use the Electoral College it helps us figure out the differents of each election. For example, when a president or government is being elected we can figure out who is grtting more electives. We can see how many people are voting and how many electives did each person received. With that being said we can easily tell which person won the elective and who didn't. We can also see the percentage of votes and how many states voted for each person.

These are my reasons why I said that the Electoral College should stay with us. It is a good way to vote, it helps us see how many people voted, and it is vary fare with everyone in The United States. Its has helped us vote for governments and presidents for many years and hopfuly it will still keep on running. This is why voting is the best way to make things equal with everyone because it is done by electing. Why would we want to take something away like the Electoral College when it was established by our own Founding Fathers?",0,"tensor([[ 0.1095, -0.2358,  0.1199,  ..., -0.3114,  0.4905,  0.4997],

"It is a controversial issue whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject.

I agree with this statement because I think it is important for people to be able to learn about many different fields of study. For example, if you want to become a doctor, you need to know a lot about medicine. If you are interested in a career as a writer, then you should be familiar with a wide variety of subjects. I also think that having a broad range of knowledge is good because it gives you more options when it comes to finding a job.

"We all go through times in our lives when we feel overwhelmed or stressed out. Many of us look for ways to manage this stress, but few of us consider mindfulness as a viable option. Mindfulness is the practice of being conscious and aware in the present moment without judgment or attachment to thoughts, feelings, and external events. It can be an effective tool to help you cope with life's challenges and stay focused on what matters most: living in the here-and-now. The concept of mindfulness has its roots in Buddhism and originated thousands of years ago; however, it wasn’t until recently that it was adopted by Western culture as a way to reduce stress levels. In order to practice mindfulness, one must first focus on breathing deeply while paying attention to their body sensations and environment around them—including sights, smells, sounds etc.—without dwelling too much on them (i.e., nonjudgmentally). As such, practicing mindfulness requires consistency--as regular practice supports better mental health outcomes over time--and patience since it does not offer instantaneous relief from stressful moments or situations. Rather than blocking out negative emotions or experiences altogether like some coping methods may do temporarily (such as drinking alcohol), engaging mindfully allows one to observe those uncomfortable feelings with clarity instead so they may begin processing them better which further helps with managing stress levels longterm rather than just momentarily masking these issues away from themselves mentally/emotionally only for them resurface later down the road again strong as ever!. Although there are many potential benefits associated with incorporating mindful practices into your life—increased self-awareness & insight about yourself/your behavior/your relationships; improved concentration & decision making skills; greater capacity for compassion towards yourself/others; overall enhanced emotional well-being—the effects that result from regularly engaging in mindful activities will vary depending upon each individual’s specific goals & needs plus their level commitment towards consistent dedicated practice each day even amidst challenging times

"Dear state senator, I am wriitting you this letter to argue about removing the Electoral college. Using the electoral college has caused some disrruption when its it comes to the votes. From the article ""The indefensible electoral college"" it says that ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors"". Who are the electors? well anyone can be an elector not holding public office. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? no. these are one of the reasons to remove the electoral college.

Also, the electoral college should be removed because of the 2000 voting fiasco that happened. from the article ""The indefensible electoral colllege"" it says it was the biggest election crisis in the century"". Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for  picking electors, and that those electors wioll always defy the will of the people. If we the people vote for our choice to run this country their should not be any of these fiascos.

Next, even presidents, AFL-CIO in their time have aggreed with this. they all want to remove the electoral college. according to the article a gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Algore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but won the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Finally,the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This system should be removed you might not know what elector you are votingfor or after that 2000 fiasco why would you still have have the electoral college.

In conclusion, these are my reasons why the electoral college should be removed. first, you wont know what elector you are voting for. Next, the 2000 fiasco. Finally, because it is unfair, outdated and irrational.",0,"tensor([[-0.7417,  0.0267, -0.3405,  ..., -0.6863,  0.6986,  0.6835],

"The influence of technology on education is a subject that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. As the digital age continues to revolutionize our modern world, we are beginning to realize the potential for tech-based learning tools and educational applications to significantly enhance the traditional educational experience, both inside and outside the classroom. From virtual reality simulations that allow students to immerse themselves in ancient historical sites, to software programs designed specifically for teaching math or science concepts, these cutting-edge technologies offer exciting new possibilities for educators who seek engaging and effective ways of delivering instruction. With so many advancements being made in this area, it is essential that teachers understand how they can use these resources effectively within their classrooms. One key way technology can be used as an instructional tool is through online courses and online lectures. By utilizing streaming video and audio capabilities available through web browsers or specialized apps such as Skype or Zoom, instructors are able to provide lectures remotely while still maintaining an interactive element with their classes—something which was not always possible before advances were made in telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, some platforms even allow instructors to set up “virtual classrooms” where all participants contribute collaboratively; when combined with other interactive features such as screen sharing capabilities or real-time chat boxes allowing questions/comments from viewers directly during presentations this type of platform can prove extremely powerful within an education context. Another major advantage technology brings into the classroom is its ability facilitate more personalized instruction based upon individual student needs and interests. Through data analytics enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms built into certain smart devices (e.g., tablets), information about each student's performance levels across various topics can be tracked over time—enabling teachers much greater insight into what works best for each student’s learning style than might have been previously attainable using conventional methods alone . Moreover services like Khan Academy allows students access free personalized lessons tailored exactly towards their skill level—they progress at a pace which suits them best

"As crazy as living without a car sounds, more and more people are doing it. One popular reason for it is for a healthier and happier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's short story titled In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

Heidrun Walter reports ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Her and many others like her in the town of Vauban, Germany have experienced the difference and felt stress go away. The city has banned driveways and home garages, encourging the rule of living ""car-free."" The people rely on public transit, bicycles and their own two legs. While many people are stressing to get a car, the people of the town feel stressed if they have a car. Over half the population sold their cars to move there, and don't regret a thing. In the article titled

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky quotes Carlos Arturo Plaza as saying ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Also Carlos Arturo Plaza goes on to say ""[it's a good oppurtinity to] lower air pollution."" People are realizing how many pollutants that cars emitt into the atmosphere. One example place is Paris, known for their terrible smog, has finally done something to clean it up. Robert Duffer wrote in

Paris bans driving due to smog

""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The law stated even numbered license plates couldn't drive one day, and the other, odd liscense plates couldn't. A little thing like this had a big effect. Duffer then reported ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Elizabeth Rosenthal in the aritcle

The End of Car Culture showed the idea "" if [these] patterns persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Americans are partically to blame for pollution. Our need for the newest, biggest, best things, has come at a cost, and more than money. Green-house gases are stacking up, and we have to take a stand some time. Rosenthal goes on to describe political leaders are working to fix this too, ""President Obama's abitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions [were] unveiled last week.""

In places already practicing the no car rule, environments have improved; more than pollution wise. Andrew Selsky reported of ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and  ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" These two additions of Bogota, Colombia have inspired many people to turn in their keys, and take a hike instead. Not only have these changes made people more happy, but it makes their city more beautiful and they are starting to get outdoors and see it. The author reports that ""municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event [car-free day] and were enthuriastic,"" amung the people visiting was the Mayor of Paraguay's capital city. When more people see the effects, they want to do the same thing. Columbia's one day event has brought about much talk in neighboring towns and even ""two other Colombian cities, Calli and Valledupar, joined the event.""

On the other side of the argument, many car industries are trying to compete with these new ideas and technology. Rosenthal quotes in

The End Of Car Culture

""But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" As humans advance into the ideas of walking, biking, or taking public transportation, car companies strive to become known for things other than cars. They want to be able to sell you things still, even if you don't want or need a car. Later she writes how Bill Ford proposed the fresh idea at the Mobile World Congress that car dealers should ""partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" This long quote simply means having all forms of transportion and the new technology in communications to be one, for the better of the people.

With or without cars, we all are always on the move. Some cities have adapted new ideas to get from place to place, or simply old ideas, being put back into action. Although Henry Ford would probably be dissapointed at his invention being faded out, Mother Nature would be pleased of us taking care of Earth. We never know what the future holds, but we do know, we'll always only have one home, so we better take care of it.",0,"tensor([[-0.1949, -0.2087, -0.0176,  ..., -0.1836,  0.8497, -0.0418],

"The importance of a healthy lifestyle cannot be overstated. Eating nutritious meals and exercising regularly are essential for maintaining physical and mental wellbeing, as well as preventing costly medical bills in the future. It is especially important for children to maintain a healthy lifestyle early on, so they can develop strong habits that will stay with them throughout their lives. In today's world, it is all too easy to lead an unhealthy lifestyle. Fast food restaurants are plentiful while gyms can seem intimidating or out of reach financially speaking. But there are still a variety of ways to live a healthy life without spending lots of money or having gym access. Making simple swaps like opting for grilled chicken instead of fried chicken at fast food restaurants, drinking water instead of soda, and taking more active modes of transportation such as biking or walking when possible can significantly help increase overall health levels. Additionally, cooking meals at home using nutrient-rich ingredients makes it easier to control what goes into your body; if you have access to fresh fruits and vegetables from farmer’s markets or even grocery stores then incorporating these items into your diet should become part of your routine if not already done so . . Engaging in regular physical activity is also critical for leading a healthy life. This does not always mean going to the gym; activities like jogging around the neighborhood each morning before work, playing sports with friends after school/work hours ,or joining recreational teams/clubs within one's community provide great alternatives that often come with little cost involved but offer huge benefits physically and mentally speaking . Increasing opportunities such as free yoga classes offered by local churches or museums could further encourage people who may otherwise feel intimidated by fitness centers filled with expensive equipment they do not know how to use yet . . Achieving good health requires effort but it doesn't require breaking budgets either—it just takes some initiative! By making small changes every day towards creating healthier habits we open ourselves up to reaping major rewards both immediately (feeling

"I agree that the government should spend more money on medical care and education than on building theaters and sports stadiums. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.

The first reason is that medical care and education are essential services that are necessary for the health and well-being of citizens. Medical care is necessary to keep citizens healthy and to provide necessary treatments and medications when they become ill. Education is also necessary to ensure that citizens have the knowledge and skills to be productive members of society. Both of these services are essential for the long-term health and prosperity of a nation.

The second reason is that medical care and education are more cost-effective than building theaters and sports stadiums. While theaters and sports stadiums can provide entertainment and bring in revenue, they are expensive to build and maintain. They also require a large amount of resources and manpower to operate. On the other hand, medical care and education require fewer resources and are more cost-effective in the long run.

The third reason is that medical care and education have a greater impact on the quality of life for citizens. Medical care provides necessary treatments and medications that can improve the health and well-being of citizens. Education provides citizens with the knowledge and skills they need to be successful in life. Both of these services can help to reduce poverty, improve economic opportunities, and create a better quality of life for citizens.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should spend more money on medical care and education than on building theaters and sports stadiums. Medical care and education are essential services that are necessary for the health and well-being of citizens. They are also more cost-effective and have a greater impact on the quality of life for citizens. Therefore, it is important that the government prioritize these services over building theaters and sports stadiums.

"The importance of getting adequate sleep for college students cannot be overstated. College can be a stressful and overwhelming time, making it important to prioritize one's physical and mental well-being in order to succeed academically. Getting enough restorative sleep is an essential part of that process. Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation, which is necessary for the learning process to occur effectively. Therefore, by not sleeping enough or consistently sleeping late into the night, college students are actually hindering their own academic progress as they will not be able to recall or understand material as easily as they would if they had gotten sufficient restful sleep prior to studying. In addition, getting too little on an ongoing basis can also lead to difficulty concentrating during class lectures and taking longer amounts of time when completing assignments due to fatigue from lack of sleep. Adequate rest has been proven more beneficial than cramming sessions with regard to academic performance; therefore prioritizing regular bedtimes should become a lifestyle change for anyone who wishes to excel in school work while still having some free time available afterwards. Furthermore, just eight hours each night is recommended for most people but individual requirements may vary depending on age group and other personal factors such as health issues or body type so determining what works best with trial and error might prove helpful in this circumstance. Additionally, healthy habits including reducing exposure screens late at night (especially blue light emitting devices) engaging in relaxing activities like journaling before going off lights out will help ensure quality shuteye - even if it doesn't always come easy!. In conclusion, getting adequate sleep is paramount when striving towards academic excellence while pursuing higher education levels such as college degrees; without proper restorative periods throughout the week individuals are likely setting themselves up for failure instead feeling energetic every morning refreshed ready take tackle whatever comes their way!

"There are few things that can compare to the joy of watching a beautiful sunset unfold in front of your eyes. Whether it be from the middle of a bustling city or perched atop a hill overlooking miles and miles of breathtaking countryside, soaking in the last rays of light as day fades into night is an incomparably magical experience. When I'm lucky enough to witness this natural wonder, my favorite way to take part in it is with photography; capturing shots from different angles and locations around me allows me to really appreciate each unique moment while also holding on to those memories forever. My strategy usually involves packing some snacks and moving myself around until I find just the right spot with the perfect view – then I'll wait patiently for nature's showstopper performance. Beginning with shades ranging from vibrant oranges, pinks, purples, reds, yellows — so many colors overlapping one another — when combined create an astonishingly beautiful paintbrush stroke across the entire sky.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and its role in the selection of the President of the United States. After careful consideration of the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As outlined by Judge Richard Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system eliminates the possibility of prolonged disputes over the election results, as the winner is determined by achieving a majority of the electoral votes. This certainty is essential in maintaining the stability and legitimacy of the presidential election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation, rather than just a particular region. This is crucial for fostering national cohesion and ensuring that the interests and needs of all citizens are taken into account. As Judge Posner points out, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in different states and engage with voters from diverse backgrounds.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. This not only enhances the political engagement of voters residing in these states but also encourages candidates to listen to their concerns and address their issues. As mentioned in Judge Posner's text, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College benefits large states by restoring some political balance that they would otherwise lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Smaller states receive attention from presidential candidates despite their smaller population sizes. This ensures that candidates address the concerns of citizens from different states, regardless of their size, and prevents larger states from dominating the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections that occur when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the presidential election process and reduces the potential complications associated with run-off elections. With the Electoral College, a clear winner is always produced, providing a decisive result without the need for subsequent elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a critical mechanism for ensuring a stable and inclusive presidential election process. Its retention is justified based on the certainty of outcome, the representation of the entire nation, the emphasis on swing states, the balanced attention given to large states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. While concerns have been raised about the system, I believe that the benefits outweigh any perceived limitations. I urge you to consider these points in your deliberations on this important matter.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision that serves the best interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.9646, -0.1390, -0.6565,  ..., -0.4511,  0.0999,  0.5927],

When the author counters that arguement by stating ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limiting insight on ground conditions because most forms of light can not penetrate the dense atmosphere..."".

The author then rebutls this by saying how researchers are finding out ways to make machines that can survive long enough on the surface of the planet, and they have also looked back at the machanical computures used in the 1940's during World War II. By looking at these ideas for solutions to the problem, being no human being able to get close enough to the surface without dying, scientists and researchers are coming up with different and new ways to aproach the planet and study Venus. The author also explains how silicon carbide could withstand the intense preasure that Venus has, which in turn could help the exploration and study of the ""Evening Star"" planet. The author uses the facts they've receved to give an idea of what the planet is like, and then explains what scientists and researchers are doing with that knowledge to create a device, or devices, that could get within the atmosphere, land, and survive oon the planet long enough to study Venus.",0,"tensor([[-6.0600e-01,  2.3871e-01, -2.1200e-01,  ..., -1.5416e-01,

"Achieving success in the world of sports requires skill, hard work, and determination. This is especially true when it comes to professional basketball; a game that pits the best athletes from all corners of the globe against one another in an effort to win championships. To be successful on the court takes more than just natural talent; players must be willing to put in countless hours perfecting their craft. NBA superstars like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have become iconic for not only their athletic abilities but also for their commitment to excellence through hard work and dedication. Michael Jordan once said “The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I worked hard every day” – a statement that sums up his uncompromising attitude towards achieving greatness. He was relentless in pushing himself and his teammates beyond what they thought was possible by always demanding better results both on and off the court – an approach which earned him six championships with the Chicago Bulls as well as numerous individual awards over his illustrious career. Similarly, Kobe Bryant wasn't afraid to put forth maximum effort every game even if it cost him wins or personal accolades, citing team success as being paramount over any individual achievement he could acquire himself. His 'Mamba mentality' has since been adopted by many aspiring athletes looking to emulate his drive and ambition,. LeBron James is another example of how putting forth your best efforts can lead to incredible success. Considered one of the greatest players ever, LeBron's focus on working smarter rather than harder has allowed him achieve something even greater: transforming entire communities across America with social initiatives such as The Promise Land Family Center which provide resources for underprivileged youth growing up without access or opportunity available elsewhere due this selfless dedication–providing them guidance wherever needed whether educationally or financially. In conclusion, while having exceptional physical talents may help get you into professional basketball - staying there requires much more than natural ability alone; commitment is key! Players like

"Today I am discussing the topic about the ""Face"".

I am discussing this topic with someone who thinks that it was created by aliens.

So today I am going to talk to him about it, and give him facts that it was indeed not greated by aliens.

That it is just a common landform that is on Mars.

One reason is that NASA would say if it was there.

We would tell people if it was really created by aliens.

We would tell people because, it would be very benifitial for NASA.

I mean NASA's budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

I there was why would we hide it. It would be one of the most greatest discoveries in NASA's history.

We could then really look into building a civilitation on Mars because, we would know that it has been done before.

We would want the world to know that NASA has found what once has been a civilization on Mars.

I not going to lie to you, it also would bring in alot of money for us.

Just like in the past it was a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appered in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.

We would want that all to happen again, so why wouldn't we tell.

Another reason is that we how such advanced tecnology now we would be able to see if there was an ancient civilization.

One example is the pictures that was taken of the ""Face"".

The camera that took the pictures spans 1.56 meters. So in the picture you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

The point is if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, or Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you would be able to tell what they were.

My last reason is that you can compare the ""Face"" to common landforms on Earth.

It can be compared to something equivalent of a butte or mesa.

A butte or mesa are common landforms around the American West.

It can be compared to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

That is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mese, which is what probably happened on Mars, because they are about the same height.

So now you know my reasons why I think that the ""Face"" was not created by aliens.

Those reasons again are: NASA would tell becuase it would be benifitial to us, we have the tecnology to tell if something was there, and it can be compared to similar things on Earth.

NASA would want all of this to happen so why would we keep it all a secret?",0,"tensor([[-0.0103, -0.2766,  0.2961,  ..., -0.2668,  0.8570,  0.3630],

"The modern day college student is faced with a unique set of challenges, the most prominent being financial. With rising tuition rates and living costs, the average college student often struggles to make ends meet while still trying to focus on their studies and academic pursuits. For many students, taking out loans or working part-time jobs are necessary in order to afford higher education. This can be stressful as it takes away from time that could have been spent studying or participating in extracurricular activities and social events. Luckily for today's college students there are several ways to reduce the financial burden associated with pursuing a post-secondary degree. One effective strategy for managing finances is budgeting; setting aside money each month towards rent, food expenses and other bills gives students an understanding of where their hard earned cash is going each month so they can plan accordingly when it comes time to pay bills or purchase supplies essential for class work such as textbooks or laptops. Additionally, scholarships play an important role in helping alleviate some of the costs related to attending university as do bursaries which offer grants based on academic merit or financial need depending on who offers them up. Finally, finding alternative sources of income can also help lighten a student’s load financially speaking; whether through freelancing online using sites such as Fiverr or Upwork (for those with certain skills)or working part-time at local businesses like cafes during breaks at school - these options can provide extra cash without having too much stress placed upon already busy schedules due to classes and exams throughout the semester/year . Moreover , looking into ways one might save money rather than just earning more has become increasingly popular amongst students - things like carpooling cautiously when travelling long distances , utilizing public transport systems instead of always relying on cars , shopping second hand clothing instead of buying expensive new clothes etc . These simple measures add up over time allowing one more leeway when it comes paying off debts accumulated from tuition fees . .

    One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. 

Rather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.",1,"tensor([[-0.1454, -0.3079, -0.8188,  ..., -0.1482,  0.2902,  0.2722],

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Global Perspective

As our world becomes increasingly urbanized, the story of our relationship with cars is changing. From the car-free German suburb of Vauban to policies curtailing car use in Paris during smog-filled days, and even a ""Day Without Cars"" in Bogota, there are clear benefits to limiting car usage. 

Firstly, eliminating cars from our daily lives can have profound effects on our environment. It is common knowledge that cars contribute a significant amount to greenhouse gas emissions. As Rosenthal states in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States (5). A move away from cars can help mitigate the environmental damage caused by these emissions.

Further, reducing car use can encourage healthier, more active lifestyles. One of the benefits of the car-free suburb of Vauban is the quiet streets where pedestrians and cyclists are king (3). By making roads more hospitable to non-motorized travelers, we can create healthier communities that encourage walking and bicycling over sitting in cars.

Moreover, limiting car usage also spurs the growth of more sustainable public transportation systems. In Vauban, a tram system serves as an alternative to cars and promotes a sense of community (2). Affordable and well-functioning public transit is instrumental in reducing car usage and mitigating associated negative impacts.

Additionally, limiting car usage can also lead to reductions in congestion and air pollution. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" author Robert Duffer outlines how a temporary driving ban in Paris resulted in congestion down by 60% (14). For dense, urban cities, limited car usage could make travel easier and more efficient for everyone.

Furthermore, cities globally are revamping their infrastructures to support and even embrace the car-less phenomenon. As noted in another of Rosenthal's articles, ""The End of Car Culture,"" companies like Ford and Mercedes are transforming themselves into ""mobility"" companies instead of car makers, reflecting the shifting cultural trend away from car dependence (34).

In conclusion, strategies to limit car usage are increasingly becoming substantial components of urban planning. The benefits of such changes, which include environmental protection, healthier lifestyles, enhancement of community vitality, reduction of congestion, and pollution control, are too significant to ignore. The global shift towards limited car use could mark a critical turning point towards a more sustainable, healthier future.",1,"tensor([[-0.6011, -0.3549, -0.5172,  ..., -0.2161,  0.5860, -0.3081],

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, communities can contribute to reducing these emissions and combatting climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can experience cleaner and healthier air. This can have both immediate and long-term benefits for public health, as well as reduce the occurrence of respiratory problems and other health issues related to pollution.

In addition, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrates how removing cars from the streets can result in less traffic and more efficient transportation. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit, communities can reduce the number of cars on the road and improve overall traffic flow.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable and compact communities. The passage on the German suburb of Vauban illustrates how designing communities to be less car-dependent can create a more environmentally friendly and livable environment. By placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, communities can become more accessible and promote a sense of community engagement.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions how car ownership in Vauban is limited, with 70% of families not owning cars. This can result in cost savings for individuals who no longer have to bear the expenses associated with car ownership, such as gas, maintenance, and parking. Additionally, communities can free up space previously allocated to parking lots and garages, which can be repurposed for other uses such as parks or community spaces.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, alleviation of traffic congestion, creation of more sustainable communities, and economic benefits. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and designing communities with less dependence on cars, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"tensor([[-0.3796, -0.2125, -0.8681,  ..., -0.3419,  0.3040, -0.0643],

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

"It is generally accepted that knowledge of facts is essential for students to succeed in their studies. However, it is also true that understanding ideas and concepts is even more important. I agree with this statement and will explain why in this essay.

First of all, having a basic understanding of facts is necessary in order to comprehend concepts. For example, a student studying mathematics needs to have a firm grasp of the basics such as addition and subtraction before they can understand more complex concepts like algebra or calculus. Similarly, a student studying history needs to have a basic understanding of dates and events before they can begin to understand why certain events unfolded the way they did. In this way, facts serve as the foundation upon which ideas and concepts are built.

However, it is important to note that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. This is because understanding concepts allows students to apply their knowledge to new situations. For example, a student who has a deep understanding of the scientific method can use this concept to solve a variety of problems, even if they do not know the specific facts related to that problem. Similarly, a student who has a deep understanding of the principles of democracy can use this to analyze and evaluate the political systems of different countries, even if they do not know the specifics of each system. In this way, understanding concepts allows students to think critically and apply their knowledge to new situations.

Finally, understanding concepts allows students to make connections between different topics. For example, a student who understands the principles of economics can make connections between economics and other fields such as politics or sociology. This type of cross-disciplinary thinking is essential for students who wish to excel in their studies and become well-rounded individuals.

In conclusion, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding concepts allows students to apply their knowledge to new situations, think critically, and make connections between different topics. Therefore, it is essential for students to focus on understanding concepts in order to become well-rounded and successful individuals.

"The Facial Action Coding System or FACS, in my opinion could be very helpful and useful in the future. The reason I say this is because, there are many students that get very bored, very unamused, confused and irritated with school work. And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily.

In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, ""calculate emotions"". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, ""It could be an effective human instructor."". This could be very effective on students and teachers. I say this because, if a student is bored or confused an ad that pops up could help them realize some things and help put them on track and hopefully get interested.

"With all this talk about greenhouse gasses, you think to yourself ""What can i do to change all of this?"". It's not as hard as you think. Some cities in foreign countries and this one are actually giving up their licence short term or long term so that the can walk, bike, carpool, or take public transportation rather than taking their own car. This is a great thing, especially with global warming and such. Some advantages of limiting car usage can be: a less stressful and safe life, a reduction in harmful gasses, and a healthier lifestyle.

When you walk around your town depending on the size of it you see a lot of cars. You have to walk around on the sidewalks and worry about the fact that a small mistake by a driver can end your life. But in a city that has no cars driving around, you don't have to worry about that at all. You can not worry about how much the gas prices are because you may be car pooling or taking the bus. In "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she asked a citizen on what she thought of the no car law, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" line 3, she saw how having no fastmoving hunks of metal can be a very stresses situation. A community that doesn't have this stress can worry about other things now.

It's often talked about in the news. Greenhouse gasses. Global warming. We hear about all the time and how it's affected by emissions of cars. How could we avoid it? Simple, we stop driving around so much. Cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and we in the United States make up 50 percent of it Elisabeth Rosenthal, line 5. It's especially bad in Paris, where the gasses are so bad that there was 5 days of smog, only rivaled by Beijing, China the most polluted city in the world Robert Duffer, line 14, which it's so bad in Beijing the citizens of the city have to wear masks covering their noses and mouths to protect themselves from the harmful gasses. It's horrible that people have to live in such horrible conditions.

If you gave up driving to everywhere you go, you wouldn't just help the world with greenhouse gasses, you'd also be helping yourself. People nowadays sit at home watching TV and snacking. But do you know how much walking and biking could do to help the health of people. This would be the case if there was a limitation on driving cars. Getting exersize is also a great stressreliever. Also it helps with the nasty smog that's been mentioned. People wouldn't be breathing in harmful gasses if there was a limitation or ban to car usage in most contries. Air pollution effects all of us as human beings.

Most of us can't think of a society without cars, but it's very possible. We can, however, make a society exactly like that to some extent. Running around screaming about global warming won't do much unless you take action. Not only will it help the Earth to have better air, it can help lead a more stressfree, safe life and a healthier one that'll only need you to walk or bike to some places.",0,"tensor([[-0.3121,  0.0854,  0.1256,  ..., -0.5709,  0.7827, -0.0621],

"Animals have been a source of companionship and sustenance for people since the dawn of civilization. The question of how to best utilize them has been a subject of debate for centuries. Some people argue that animals should be treated as pets, while others believe that they should be used as resources for food and clothing. In my opinion, animals should not be viewed as simply resources but should be respected and protected.

First of all, animals possess the same basic rights as humans. All creatures deserve to be respected and treated with kindness and compassion. Keeping animals as pets allows us to form meaningful bonds with them, giving them a sense of belonging and providing them with the love and affection that every living being deserves.

In addition, animals are essential to the balance of the environment. They regulate the flow of energy in their ecosystems and help maintain biodiversity. For example, bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants, while predators such as wolves help keep herbivore populations in check. Thus, if we exploit animals as resources, we are disrupting the delicate balance of nature and ultimately endangering our own species as well.

Finally, animals provide us with invaluable companionship and entertainment. Many people find joy in pet ownership and take comfort in the companionship of their beloved animal friends. Pets can also provide us with therapeutic and emotional benefits, such as reducing stress and improving our overall mental health. There is no denying the positive impact that animals can have on our lives.

In conclusion, animals should not be viewed as simply resources for food and clothing. Rather, we should respect and protect them, for they are essential to the balance of nature and provide us with invaluable companionship and entertainment. By treating animals with kindness and compassion, we can ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy their many benefits for years to come.

"I don't think there should be a limit on car usage if you bought it you can ride till the wheels fall off it's your propery but also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes. But America's love afair with it's vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peeked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. as of April 2013,the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the eplanation certainly lie  in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways.

"Don't you have those times when you are having trouble on what to wear for your friend's birthday party, or what to say to that special someone, wouldn't it be helpful to have a second opinion? Deciding on what to do in a situation can sometimes be a really hard task to handle, but lucky for you, the advice of your peers can help you form a good decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you see different perspectives, learn more information, and get a general opinion.

One way asking others can benefit you is that you can see situations from other perspectives. People come from all around the world and have their own ideals and cultures which influence their way of thinking. Take a rug for example, some people have a rug as a place to clean your shoes while others use a rug as a place to practice their religion. The value of others will help you see things differently and with more meaning. It is good to understand the culture and customs of others to form good opinions. No two minds think alike, everyone thinks of different ways to do things. These ideas help you understand the different views of others, and they can help you understand why some people do certain things. Some people have experienced events that can completely alter their way of thinking. Talking to someone who has experienced whatever you may be looking for is a wonderful source because you have first hand knowledge and is a far better way of understanding something than just looking at the internet that is too good to be true. By looking through the shoes of others, you can see different opinions based on, cultures and ideals, past experiences, and unique mindsets.

Another way opinions could help is by giving you information that you couldn't have known otherwise. Maybe you are interested in doing something but do not know how it is like. You could talk to someone who has experienced how it is like and they could help you form a educated opinion. The Internet is a good source of information, but is everything that the internet say factually correct? Misinformation is something that could spread very easily and could give people negative or positive opinions on something false. It is always good to talk to someone who is skilled in that area to know exactly what to do. Sometimes something is just too hard to understand and thus, you don't what to do. Never be afraid to ask the people around you for a second opinion especially if your at a store because they are trained to know and to help you. Knowledge is one way others can help you form a opinion with past experiences, being skilled, and stopping misinformation.

Asking for the opinions of others could help you form a general opinion. A general opinion lets you know how everyone feels about what you are talking about. If you go around and ask people if you should wear a green dress and the majority of people say no, it tells you that green is not the color you should wear. By knowing how others view a certain subject, it lets you know what to plan. Knowing what others are most likely going to think, you can use that to help you understand what your next course of action should be. The general opinion of what others think will let you know if something is working. If you begin a project in which people be rewarded with vegetables and over time people start to participate less and less, it lets you know that it is not a good solution. Getting a general opinion will let you know the views of others, if something is working, and how to plan accordingly.

In conclusion, there are many ways the opinions of others can influence you to make healthy decision: past experiences, different backgrounds, ideals, and cultures can all lead you to the right direction. Seeking multiple opinions help people find better choices by seeing the perspectives of others, learning information from others, and getting a general idea of what others think. Never be afraid to ask your friends, family, or the people around you for a second opinion. It could lead you to a very good resolution.",0,"tensor([[ 4.0456e-01, -3.8314e-01, -6.1921e-01,  ...,  1.4048e-01,

"In today's fast-paced world, many people feel stressed and overwhelmed by their work. It is a common belief that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. I completely agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide several reasons to support my opinion.

Firstly, the modern workplace is highly competitive, which puts a lot of pressure on employees. Nowadays, companies are focused on maximizing profits, and they often expect their workers to do more work in less time. This means that employees have to work harder and longer hours, which can lead to burnout and stress-related illnesses. Moreover, job security is becoming less common, and people are often worried about losing their jobs. This creates a stressful working environment that can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

Secondly, technology has dramatically changed the way people work. While technological advancements have made work easier and more efficient, it has also created a culture of constant connectivity. Employees are expected to be available 24/7, and this can create a feeling of being always ""on"". This can lead to stress and anxiety, as people struggle to maintain a work-life balance.

Thirdly, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This means that people are constantly required to think and make decisions, which can lead to mental exhaustion. Moreover, people often have to work in isolation, which can lead to a sense of loneliness and disconnection from others. This can be highly stressful, and it can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

In conclusion, work nowadays is undoubtedly more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. The modern workplace is highly competitive, and employees are expected to work harder and longer hours. Technology has made work more efficient but has also created a culture of constant connectivity. And finally, the nature of work has changed, and many people are now engaged in jobs that require high levels of cognitive skills. This has created a stressful working environment that can negatively impact people's mental and physical health. Therefore, it is crucial to find ways to reduce stress in the workplace and create a healthy work-life balance.

"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. The technology uses 46 facial muscles to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how this technology can be used to read the emotional expressions of people in various settings, including classrooms. While some may argue that using FACS in classrooms is valuable, I believe that it raises several concerns.

Firstly, using FACS to monitor students' emotions may infringe on their privacy. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their facial expressions are being tracked and analyzed. This could lead to a lack of trust between students and teachers, and may create a negative learning environment. Moreover, it is important to note that facial expressions are not always an accurate indicator of emotions. Students may be feeling anxious or stressed, but their facial expressions may not necessarily reflect that. Therefore, relying solely on FACS to assess students' emotions may not provide an accurate picture of their well-being.

Secondly, FACS may be used to label students as ""problematic"" or ""difficult."" If a student is frequently detected to have a negative expression, they may be perceived as uncooperative or disruptive. This could lead to unfair treatment and stigma for the student. Furthermore, labeling students in this way may create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where students are expected to behave in a certain way based on their perceived emotions. This could limit students' potential and hinder their ability to develop and grow.

Thirdly, FACS may not take into account individual differences in facial expressions and emotions. People from diverse cultural backgrounds may have different facial expressions and emotional responses. FACS may not be able to accurately detect emotions for students from diverse backgrounds, leading to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. Additionally, FACS may not account for other factors that may influence students' emotions, such as their home life, social relationships, or learning style.

Lastly, FACS may be used as a tool for control rather than support. Teachers may use FACS to monitor students' emotions and adjust their teaching methods accordingly. While this may sound beneficial, it could lead to a lack of autonomy for students. Students may feel like they are being constantly watched and judged, rather than being trusted to take responsibility for their own learning.

In conclusion, while FACS may be a valuable tool in certain settings, its use in classrooms raises several concerns. It may infringe on students' privacy, label students unfairly, fail to account for individual differences, and be used as a tool for control rather than support. Therefore, I argue that FACS should not be used to read the emotional expressions of students in classrooms. Instead, teachers should focus on creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment, where students feel comfortable and empowered to take ownership of their learning.",1,"tensor([[-0.1899, -0.1468, -0.4944,  ..., -0.1305, -0.5237,  0.4467],

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.

Body:

Paragraph 1:

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.

Paragraph 2:

Beyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.

Paragraph 3:

Additionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.

Paragraph 4:

The success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. It is essential for citizens and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards making our communities more sustainable and livable for future generations.",1,"tensor([[-0.4647, -0.2845, -0.8857,  ..., -0.3224,  0.2880, -0.2600],

"It should be able to be used in the classroom because, people like themselves or the teacher should know how they are feeling today or want to know how they are feeling on certrain days, and what emotions they aren having. It also can be used in science so we should be able to learn this especially sincewe all have emotions and why not spice science up since we do have a science class. It can help us learn more about emotions and how can we actually can tell how we are really feeling. I think we should also have them because it said in paragraph 6 ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and I think that will help us cause the teachers can then see we need help trying to understand or need to take breaks becuase we have became bored and or confuse. I also would love to use this to find out how my friends emotions are on a certain day because I wouldnt want to bother them if they are angry or sad. I would also use it for my teacher. I think it would be fun to use in school and it would actually catch the children atttention in school.

Currently, not having cars have helped the community be a better place, many ride bicycles places and you can hear the sound of children playing in the streets ""drowning out the sound of distant motors.""

The reason they are working to make a car free nation is because recently Passenger cars are the reason for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and it even goes up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the U.S!

The U.S Environmental Protection Agency promotes ""car reduced"" communities, even legislators are starting to act. With the decrease of cars it would bring many benefits, You would have less deaths from drunk driving or driving in general, It would be safer for your children to play in the streets, pollution would go down to a low, the chances of rode rage would go to a very low, and no cars would also mean many stores would be built closer to homes so its in walking distance. Also we would most likely have more public transport so the need for cars wouldn't be needed.

Another place that is working their way into being car free is BOGOTA, Colombia; Recently they had a specific day where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work because it was a car free day. Violators faced $25 fines if they went against it. Even with rain people have still participated, people know that they are making the community a better place one car less at a time. It has also been a good opportunity to lower stress and air pollution in our environment. For the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar also joined the event. Even Municipal authorities from other countries came with enthusiasm to see this event. One of them by the name Enrique Riera stated ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" This campaign had started in the mid-1990s and has since cause the construction of 118 bike paths according to the city mayor. Also parks and sports centers have become a bigger thing and have been built all throughout the city. uneven sidewalks have been replaced with fresh neat side walks, rush hours restrictions have cut traffic, and new shopping and restaurants of started to show.

Recently in Paris After days of near record pollution, Paris had to ban all driving because the smog was just way too bad. It was so bad that they would fine you $31 if you got caught leaving the house with a car. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their reaction. Cold nights and warm days are the main cause of the car trap emmisions. Diesel fuel was also blamed since France has a tax policy that put diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, Compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of West Europe.",0,"tensor([[-0.0649, -0.4260,  0.3421,  ..., -0.2301,  0.7684, -0.2900],

Do to to our current limit in technology and the harsh ecosystem on Venus, it is is extremely hard for us to find out any information about this planet. Many people wonder why scientist still try to find out more information about Venus. The reason is that Venus's ecosystem could have been similar to ours many years ago. Since the planet shows signs of mountains, valleys and craters we can safley assume their was once an ocean on the now uninhabitable planet. Many scientist believe that we can safley hover above Venus's atomsphere to get a better look at it.

For one, the internet is a vast and ever-growing resource that can be used to access information at any time. Additionally, the written word is more durable than the internet, meaning that it can be used to store and share information for longer periods of time. Finally, the written word is more affordable than the internet, meaning that it can be used more often and for a wider range of purposes. In all of these respects, the written word may eventually become the main source of information.

"Attitudes are considered beliefs or opinions that an individual holds about something or someone. These attitudes can be influenced by the immediate situation or surroundings that the individual is in. However, whether or not these external factors are more influential than any internal characteristic is a topic of debate. In this essay, I will argue that people's attitudes are determined by both their immediate situation and internal characteristics.

Firstly, immediate situations or surroundings can have a significant impact on an individual's attitude. For example, if a person is in a happy and positive environment, they are likely to have a positive attitude towards whatever they are doing. On the other hand, if someone is in a negative environment, they are more likely to have a negative attitude towards things. These external factors can include their friends, family, workplace, or social setting. For instance, if people around an individual have negative thoughts about a certain topic, that individual is more likely to adopt the same negative attitude towards that topic.

Secondly, it is important to recognize that internal characteristics also play a crucial role in determining people's attitudes. Personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness can play a significant role in shaping attitudes. For instance, a person with high levels of agreeableness is more likely to have positive attitudes towards other people since they have a tendency to be cooperative and empathetic. Similarly, a person with high levels of openness to experience is more likely to have an open-minded attitude towards different perspectives and ideas.

Moreover, internal characteristics can also help people resist the influences of external factors. For example, if an individual has a strong sense of personal values and beliefs, they are less likely to be influenced by their surroundings or immediate situation. In such cases, they are more likely to hold onto their own personal beliefs and attitudes regardless of what others around them believe.

In addition, it is also important to recognize that people's attitudes can change over time. It is not necessary that an individual's attitude remains the same throughout their life. They can be influenced by both internal and external factors, and their attitudes can change as a result. For example, if an individual is exposed to new information or experiences, their attitudes towards a particular subject can change.

To sum up, people's attitudes are influenced by both internal and external factors. While immediate situations or surroundings can impact an individual's attitude, internal characteristics such as personality traits, personal beliefs, and values also play a significant role in shaping attitudes. Moreover, people's attitudes can change over time, as they are exposed to new experiences and information. Therefore, it is essential to consider both internal and external factors when analyzing people's attitudes.

"The Case of the Face on Mars

Many people look at the famous sandstone formation on Mars and see the etched face of an alien creature. However, examination of the facts and evidence clearly indicate this so-called ""Face on Mars"" is simply a natural landform shaped by geological processes over millions of years. 

There are several key reasons to believe the Face is of natural origin and not an artifact of alien visitation. First, the scale of the landform is inconsistent with what we would expect from an intentionally carved monument. At over two kilometers wide, it is far too large to reasonably depict a facial likeness at that size from any appreciable distance. A naturally occurring mesa or butte eroded into unusual patterns provides a much more plausible explanation. 

Second, high resolution images from orbiters like Mars Global Surveyor reveal the details in the Face are superficial and lack true depth or artistic precision in form. Eroded layers in the cliff expose differing strengths of rock that weather unevenly, creating cracks and shadows that trick the eye into perceiving facial features where none truly exist. Wind and water erosion over eons easily account for such accidental patterns.

Finally, numerous other similar yet ambiguous formations have been observed across Mars, indicating this sort of superficial landform is quite common through natural geological weathering. If the Face was artificially sculpted, we would expect to find only that single, isolated example. Its very ordinariness as a wind-scoured mesa strongly suggests a lack of intent or design behind its appearance. 

In conclusion, careful study based on the evidence reveals the Face on Mars derives from natural rather than artificial causes. Its scale, lack of detail, and prevalence of similar forms all point to a straightforward geological origin, not the work of visiting aliens. While its superficial likeness to a human face captures our imagination, science-based analysis confirms it remains just another of the Red Planet's many naturally-formed landforms.",1,"tensor([[-1.0218, -0.2791, -0.7198,  ...,  0.1248,  0.1892,  0.7049],

"A man is driving in his car recklessly in a hurry to work. Not paying attention to the pedestrian crossing sign, he hits an innocent student crossing the street who later dies. It has been suggested that cars are more negative than positive. Perhaps we should decrease the amount of time we spend driving these machines. I believe that limiting car usage is a good thing for the people.

As source 2 states, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of smog."" This suggests thats cars can't be used in all conditions and it would be much safer to use a bike of simply walk. With the smog, the people of France didn't drive and there was over 50 percent less congestion on the road. In Paris, the government enforced partial bans to clear the air. On one day motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, then the next day the same rule applied to oddnumbered plates. diesel fuel was at blame for the smog since 67 percent of the vehicles in France uses it and the engines of these cars were giving off a lot of smoke. This issue can be avoided all around by using more environmentfriendly ways of transportation.

Moving on to Source 4, it provides information that the number of miles driven in America peaked in 2005 and has dropped every year since then. Even with that being said, there are still thousands of crash related deaths each year. There's drunk driving, driving while texting, and texting hile too sleepy to focus, and all situations lead to deaths. Driving is a very dangerous responsibility that gets people killed. There are other ways to get from Point A to Point B, although they might not be as quick.

Those who are attached to their Ford trucks or convertible Mustangs may say something along the line of ""I'm a responsible driver, so I won't get in a wreck."" But you never know what could happen. It's much safer to take a train or bus where there's less traffic.

Car usage, the poison of society, kills the innocent. Pedestrians across the globe are at risk of careless drivers. If nothing is done, more lives will be taken and the air will continue to be polluted.",0,"tensor([[-0.0458, -0.1300, -0.0661,  ..., -0.2251,  0.5670,  0.5421],

"Modern technology has undeniably made life more convenient in many ways. From the invention of the wheel to the internet, technology has allowed us to do things faster, easier, and more efficiently. However, some people argue that life was better when technology was simpler. While there are some merits to this argument, I disagree.

One of the main advantages of modern technology is that it has made communication much easier. We can now communicate with people from all over the world in an instant. We can also access information quickly and easily, which has made learning and research much more efficient. For example, if I want to learn about a certain topic, I can simply search for it on the internet and find a wealth of information in a matter of seconds. This would have been impossible in the past.

Modern technology has also made transportation much more convenient. We can now travel to almost any destination in the world in a matter of hours. This has opened up a world of possibilities for people who would otherwise be unable to travel. We can also use technology to make our daily lives easier. For example, we can use apps to order food, book tickets, and even do our shopping. This saves us time and energy, which would otherwise be spent running errands.

Finally, modern technology has made it possible for us to stay connected with our loved ones. We can now stay in touch with family and friends from all over the world through social media and video calls. This has made it much easier to stay connected with people, even if they are far away.

In conclusion, modern technology has made life much more convenient in many ways. From communication to transportation, technology has made it easier for us to do things faster and more efficiently. Therefore, I disagree with the idea that life was better when technology was simpler.

"Every day, people around the world are turning to vegetarianism as a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle choice. Vegetarianism is gaining popularity for numerous reasons, from environmental concerns to health benefits associated with a meatless diet. Even though there are some drawbacks to becoming a vegetarian, many believe that the pros outweigh the cons. The primary benefit of following a vegetarian diet is improved health outcomes due to increased intake of plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables which are rich in fiber and essential vitamins and minerals. Studies have shown that vegetarians tend to live longer than those who eat animal products; they also have lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type II diabetes and certain types of cancers when compared with their meat-eating counterparts. Additionally, eliminating or reducing red meats can be beneficial for cholesterol levels since these food sources contain unhealthy saturated fats which increase one’s risk for cardiovascular disease over time. From an environmental standpoint, opting out of meat consumption decreases our collective dependence on factory farming practices which harm wildlife populations by fragmenting habitats into smaller areas reserved for agricultural activity and polluting nearby ecosystems through runoff filled with harmful chemicals used in producing feed crops such as corn or soybean plants (which often require heavy fertilization). In addition, raising livestock emits methane gas -a major contributor to climate change- while production methods utilizing natural resources like water create further issues related to drought or water scarcity affecting communities reliant upon river systems where animals are grown intensively before being sold elsewhere in large numbers leading waste management challenges if not properly addressed locally within those regions first before distribution elsewhere occurs at all. . An issue that might arise when following this diet would include missing important nutrients found mostly in animal sources like protein (such as iron), iodine strontium calcium vitamin B12 zinc etc… To counteract this problem vegetarians need rely on other plant based proteins like nuts beans legumes tofu tempeh seitan quinoa amaranth plus fortified cere

Decision-making is an important life skill that has potential implications for someone's future. making decisions independently or seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have both advantages and disadvantages. Seeking external guidance, particularly from trusted and knowledgeable sources, can help someone become better informed in their decision-making and weigh their options. However, reliance on outside help can also lead to an inability to make decisions independently, which can take away an individual's autonomy in their decision-making. 

Take the example of a college student deciding what degree to pursue. If the student solely makes the decision on their own, they may feel more in control and the process more authentic. However, depending largely on their own knowledge may lead them to miss out on other potential options or choices that could have been beneficial to their future. Alternatively, seeking external guidance such as advisors, family, or educational programs can give the student an outside perspective and information not available to them individually. Though seeking outside help can potentially lead to the student feeling less autonomy and sense of freedom, this can be beneficial to their future decision-making as they will be more informed and aware of the process. 

Ultimately, making decisions involves both advantages and disadvantages of independent or external guidance that can affect the individual and their future. These should be weighed against each other prior to reaching a decision to ensure that the choice made is the best option for the individual and their future.",1,"tensor([[ 0.0373, -0.2652, -0.6342,  ..., -0.3671, -0.1430,  0.5811],

I agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson because base on each experience of every people that they had mastered, i think that what you already mastered in life it can make you be more stronger base on the experience that you had.

I agree with the quote because unless you try to something you need to have pasion and focused in things that you can grow in life over things that you already mastered. You can grow beyond and over things that you already master and learn new things to keep growing not just staying in the same spot.

Experince new things in life are going to make you feel more stronger and make you think that you can do things that you maybe never thought about that you were going to do beyond what you already mastered.

Unless that you need to reach and make new goals to grow you need to make an efort no matter how hard it can be for you, you need to focus in that goals that you want to grow more and have more experience just for keep practecing.

Base on my experiences, i could do something beyond what i already mastered because i want to learn new things and try to make good things and that's going to make me grow more and experiences new things that i never thought that i can do. To grow exterior and interion i need to be confident with my self and letting me know thing that i can do better thing that i already mastered and be more suscescfull.

"To the author, the limitations that exploring venus brings, should not be enough to kill the curiosity that many of us have. Although it has been a long time since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus, the author believes that with the technology and willpower we have today, Venus could be explored.

The author keeps referring to Venus as earth's twin. this could show that the author is trying to get across that this planet is not much different from ours. This technique can help pursuade people into believing that it is beyond possible to touch down on Venus. The author writes about alot of the reasons why we could go to Venus, but makes sure to touch on the challenges people may face and the limitations. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" These limitations stated in paragraph 3 of the article are just some of the challenges associated with exploring Venus.

The author believes even with all of the limitations, studying Venus could have so many benefits in the future. But another limitation is that hovering Venus at a safe distance might not give the insight on the conditions that people may need. Although he seems to be focusing on the negatives of it all, he brings in light to work around the limits. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for weeks in such conditions."" Here the author is bringing in the positives which ultimately outweigh the negatives. The limitations seemed to revolve around the harsh conditions, but the author introducing this peice of technology that would work around it helps support the authors ideas.

To conclude, the author has many doubts and fears about studying Venus, but remembers to tell about ways to work around the natural challenges the people would face. The authors idea that claims that studying venus is more important than the dangers pursuades many people into believing that as well. Finally, the author does a great job getting his point across.",0,"tensor([[-0.6698, -0.0766, -0.3436,  ..., -0.2013,  1.0284,  0.1964],

"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage – A Case for Sustainable Urban Living

The unprecedented growth in the usage of cars, spurred by the allure of convenience and flexibility, has contributed significantly to environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. As such, urban planners and environmentalists are increasingly advocating for a paradigm shift towards limiting car usage in favor of sustainable transportation alternatives. The experience in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing car culture, especially amongst younger generations in the United States, provides a compelling case for this transition.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, serves as a pioneering model of a car-free society. By eliminating the ability for most residents to park their cars nearby, the majority of the population has given up car ownership, living happier and less stressful lives (Rosenthal, Passage 1). This paradigm shift towards a car-free lifestyle has not only eliminated the car-related greenhouse gas emissions significantly but also created a peaceful and environmentally friendly atmosphere that promotes health and wellbeing.

In Paris, a partial ban on car usage due to elevated pollution levels produced positive results with congestion dropping by 60% and air pollution levels decreased substantially (Duffer, Passage 2). This impressive result underscores the tremendous potential of limiting car usage in alleviating the public health and environmental crises looming over urban areas globally.

Colombian cities have also experienced the benefits of limiting car usage through the 'Day Without Cars' initiative. This event saw considerable public participation, leading to less air pollution and stress, thus enhancing the overall quality of life (Selsky, Passage 3). It also doubled as a platform to promote alternative modes of transport, such as biking, that are more environmentally friendly.

In America, there is a noticeable cultural shift as people buy fewer cars and opt for alternative modes of transport. Researchers argue that this trend could significantly reduce carbon emissions since transportation is the second-largest source of America's greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, Passage 4). Moreover, increased internet connectivity and telecommuting potential, the rise of carpool apps, and city center renewal are changing the face of transport. The demographic changes, particularly amongst the younger generation, further reinforce this shift.

It becomes apparent that limiting car usage has tangible advantages. These include a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, alleviated traffic congestions, and enhanced overall quality of life. However, to fully realize these benefits, deliberate planning for public transportation systems and alternative mobility options needs to be considered. It is also crucial to communicate these benefits to the public to foster widespread adoption and facilitate this instrumental transition towards sustainable living.",1,"tensor([[-0.2323, -0.1849, -0.4169,  ...,  0.0489,  0.2544, -0.3776],

"The argument that the face is a natural landfrom is true because there is evedince in the passage backing up my fact.

First he took three pictures one in 1976,1998 and 2001 in 1976 they didnt have good camera he just showed the outline of the butte or mesa landform. In 1998 it was in the winter for the planet was so it change the outlook on the butte. 2001 was the best by far it was during the summer and it was the most recent one taken

Second in 1976 the camera was even close as it is now.

In 1998 the camera made a big step and made the image have the best resolution having a stuning 1.56 meter compared to the 43 meters in 1976 they only problem it was in winter and it was really hazy. So in 2001 they took another image it was not even close to ether of the photos in 1976 or 1998

It made it look like it was a face but thank to better cameras we can see that it is not a face it was just a butte.",0,"tensor([[-0.7204, -0.2287,  0.6033,  ..., -0.9390,  1.1112, -0.2704],

"The electoral college doesn't work for everyone its not fair. There are people who want a good president to run the conutry, not just some guy that the electors pick. Electorl College is not a good way to pick a president the people are not picking them isnt that want it suppost to be people pick the president not electors. In the text the author write that the electorl college doesnt let the people that have the most vote win because your picking a elector and the elector is picking the president even though he/she has the most vote its not fair. We the people should be the ones picking the president, we are the one who want him/her to run the coutry because we think he/she can do it.  The electoral college should be abolishied and people should pick the president.

There are state in our conurty that are smaller then other states. Those small states dont get a say in the voting for the president because the bigger states rule over because of the electorl college rule. The author says ""larger states like Flordia has 29 electorl vote and Wyoming only has 3 electorl votes."" So that means that the larger states get more attention form the president then the smaller states do. That's not fair the smaller states should be treated like the bigger states not left out. The electrol college (electors)is the one picking the president not the peoplein the small or large states.

"Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our enviornment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our enviornment with the air pollution; you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(14). The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the enviornment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates (11). That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution (20). Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""[i]t's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful enviornment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing (3). Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" (9). If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the enviornment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0757, -0.1770,  0.0552,  ..., -0.2009,  0.6603,  0.2376],

"From the research and development of Dr. Huang and his colleague, computers are now able to understand what people are feeling based on the muschle movement on their faces. These muscle movement can be classified into basic emotions that human are experiencing. With the help of this program, computer can detect the emotions of people and make changes accordingly. I think this technology should be brought into classrooms for students as this can help them understand better by interpreting whether they are confused or not.

In Dr. Huang's prediction, he claims that the use of this technology can recognize the emotional status of the students. When they are detected to be confused, the computer can make changes to the lessons in order to make it easier or better explained. This can accelerate the progress of the study as teachers will not be worrying about which part that students do not understand. More specific explaination can be made immediately when students seem to be confused, and skip easier parts when students become bored. Classes will be become more efficient for both teachers and students: teachers will not be guessing what students do not understand and waste time on easy parts while students will always be learning what they actually need to understand.

Not only is this technology valuable in teaching students, but also crucial in finding out the feelings of them. Because this program records muscle movements on our faces, students will not be able to show an unreal emotion or it will be detected. Therefore, when teachers are trying to help students on their emotional difficulties, such as anger and sadness, they can understand what they are actually feeling. Students will not be able to hide their feelings by making false expressions that may help them escape from the help that they actually need. Teachers can understand what students are really feeling in their real emotions, and provide help as soon and helpful as possible. This technology can be crucial to students' lives even though they may try to avoid the help that is provided as they may not understand the outcome of those bad emotions. Therefore, I believe that besides the efficiency this technology can provide in education, the importance of it for teachers to communicate better with students should also have a considerable power in deciding whether or not it should be brought into classrooms.

The development of this technology can truly help the communication between people as they are able to understand what others really feel and express. Misunderstanding can be made right through this program as people can read the expression of others. In the classroom, students' expressions to different ideas can be detected and analyzed by the teachers. They can then give extra help based on the understanding of those expressions. Students feeling upset can also be understood, and teachers' immediate attention can be provided to them. This can save much time and effort in interpreting the real feeling of the students, making the school progress much more efficient. Therefore, I think that this technology will become very valuable in classrooms with its various ways in helping students and their teachers understanding of each other.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0165, -0.3166, -0.0617,  ..., -0.4311,  0.0665,  0.3327],

"The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with his stance. He used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in his writting.

To start off his essay with some facts and expalined what he was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact he used to start his essay off was "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because he informed his readers about venus before he started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human."" ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this he is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" (paragraph 6) This supports that he is a good authour and deplaning his stance on the agurmeny becasue he can make the other side information help his stance in an way.

"""When people ask for advice, they will most likely ask multiple people"". The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!"" I'm getting off topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said its too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. There you go a essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which ever one you get you get more of the same answer and you us that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying ""finally that kids gone"".

But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with idk ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.",0,"tensor([[-1.1338e-01, -4.6679e-01, -9.9357e-02,  ..., -1.8885e-01,

"There is no doubt that computer games are popular among children. They provide a fun and stimulating way for children to spend their free time. However, some people believe that computer games have more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development. I disagree with this view.

While it is true that computer games can be addictive and lead to obesity, I believe that the positives of playing computer games outweigh the negatives. For example, computer games can help children develop problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and strategic thinking. They can also help children learn about new cultures and countries, and improve their reading and math skills.

In addition, playing computer games can help children relieve boredom and stress, and can even help them make friends. For example, the online game World of Warcraft has over 10 million players from all over the world. This game allows children to communicate with each other and work together to achieve common goals.

It is clear that computer games have both positive and negative effects on children. However, I believe that the positives of playing computer games outweigh the negatives. I urge parents to allow their children to play computer games, but to set limits on the amount of time they can spend playing them.

The article also said, ""on the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 8-- degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not ecceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

These are the reasons why the author suggested that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present.",0,"tensor([[-0.6374, -0.0104, -0.2936,  ..., -0.0742,  0.6764,  0.3421],

"Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voting and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electors have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a candidate wants to win presidency, heshe has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidential election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy, but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?

Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it. Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any sense to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.

Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? Well, the Electoral College isn't what ""we the people"" want. We want to be able to choose who we elect, not another group of people. Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two candidates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker, but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland.

This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.",0,"tensor([[-0.3797, -0.2457, -0.6438,  ..., -0.3170,  0.7022,  0.7913],

Participating in a school play is an enjoyable activity that can provide lasting memories as well as broaden your horizon. Performing in a play allows you to make plenty of new friends and connections, as it involves working closely with fellow students to rehearse and produce a great show. An enthusiastic group of people will come alive when rehearsing on stage, and the positive atmosphere will fuel collaboration and creativity. Furthermore, you will be able to share the embarrassing but funny moments that occur while practicing lines and blocking with your castmates. 

Moreover, working on a play with a team encourages everyone to embrace their individual talents while fostering a sense of inclusivity and responsibility. Everyone is on the same team and works together towards a common goal. The feeling of accomplishment once your play finally debuts is indescribable. Furthermore, performing the show before an audience is a unique and rewarding experience. You get to share your hard work and passion directly with the audience. All the weeks spent in rehearsal come together in two magical hours on stage, and you create lifelong bonds with the people you work with. 

In conclusion, participating in a school play is an enjoyable activity that can benefit you in ways more than just achieving better grades. School plays offer the opportunity to make new friends, work with a team, and perform the play in front of an audience, all of which can be rewarding experiences.",1,"tensor([[-0.0919, -0.4982, -0.3036,  ..., -0.3581,  0.2102,  0.3646],

"Computer games have become increasingly popular among children in recent years. While some people argue that computer games have had more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development, I disagree with this opinion.

First of all, computer games can help children to develop their physical skills. For example, some games require players to move their hands quickly and accurately, which can help to improve their hand-eye coordination. Furthermore, some games also require players to think quickly and make decisions in a short time, which can help to improve their reaction time. Therefore, computer games can actually help to enhance children's physical skills.

Secondly, computer games can also help to improve children's intellectual development. For example, some games require players to solve puzzles or use their logical thinking to complete tasks, which can help to improve their problem-solving skills. Furthermore, some games also require players to learn new concepts and facts, which can help to improve their knowledge and understanding. Therefore, computer games can actually help to enhance children's intellectual development.

Finally, computer games can also help to improve children's psychological development. For example, some games require players to cooperate with others in order to complete tasks, which can help to improve their social skills. Furthermore, some games also require players to make decisions and take risks, which can help to improve their decision-making skills. Therefore, computer games can actually help to enhance children's psychological development.

In conclusion, I believe that computer games can actually have positive effects on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development. Therefore, instead of preventing children from playing them, I think that parents should encourage them to play computer games in moderation and guide them to choose the right games that can help to improve their skills.

"The use of the techonology is not valuable in a classroom because students may not want anyone to know how they feel. Students should be able to keep their emotions to themselves if they do not wish to share them. Students shouldnt have to walk in class and automatically tell a teacher or a peer how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions are something a student might not want to share because they might be going throught something personal thry dont want anyone to know about. In paragraph three Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" then later on in the paragraph he says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion and communication..."" So if humans don't communicate their feelings to eachother then they probably don't want a computer to communicate them. Some people may say that that would be a good thing for students because it might help them open up more, but it would just force them to say how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions should be privite unless the person wants to share them.

"Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society today. As temperatures continue to rise, sea levels are expected to rise and extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, leading to a number of devastating consequences. From increased food insecurity in vulnerable nations to economic losses due to extreme weather disasters and coastal flooding, the effects of climate change are already being felt around the world. While global warming is largely caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, there are also a number of other factors that can contribute including natural cycles like El Nino, land-use changes and deforestation. However, reducing emissions from sources such as power plants and transportation remain critical for mitigating future impacts. Governments have implemented a variety of policies designed aimed at decreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) output; from renewable energy targets in some countries to carbon taxes in others – these efforts will be essential for combating climate change over time. Similarly, individuals need take responsibility for their own actions which can help reduce emissions on an individual level too; this includes driving fuel-efficient vehicles, using public transport where possible or cycling instead; switching off devices when not required rather than leaving them on standby; using air conditioning less frequently or insulation measures within homes which help reduce energy consumption even further still – all these small steps make an important contribution towards tackling climate change collectively . . Moreover it’s imperative that awareness about what we can do as citizens must continue too so people understand both the risks associated with inaction but also how they can play their part by adopting sustainable lifestyles themselves – making every effort count! If everyone took action together then we could create real lasting progress against this truly global challenge - one that affects us all!

"Famous people are often in the public eye, and their private lives are frequently scrutinized by the media. While some people argue that celebrities should be given more privacy, others believe that this is the price they pay for their fame. In my opinion, I believe that famous people should be given more privacy, and I will explain my reasons below.

Firstly, famous people are human beings, and they deserve to have a private life just like everyone else. They have the right to enjoy their personal life without being followed or photographed by the paparazzi. For instance, imagine how stressful it would be to have photographers following you everywhere you go, taking pictures of you without your consent. This is not only an invasion of privacy but also a violation of their basic human rights.

Secondly, the media often portrays celebrities in a negative light, and this can have a significant impact on their mental health. The constant scrutiny and criticism can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. For example, Britney Spears, a famous pop singer, had a mental breakdown in 2007, and many people attribute this to the intense media scrutiny she faced at that time.

Finally, giving famous people more privacy would also benefit the media. Currently, the media focuses on sensational stories and scandals to attract viewers and readers. However, if the media were to respect celebrities' privacy, they could focus on more positive stories, such as their achievements, charitable work, and contributions to society.

In conclusion, while some people argue that famous people should accept the media attention as the price of their fame, I believe that they should be given more privacy. Famous people are human beings, and they deserve to have a private life without being constantly followed and photographed by the media. Moreover, the media's negative portrayal of celebrities can have a significant impact on their mental health. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between the public's right to know and celebrities' right to privacy.

"I agree that people's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making. This can include conscious and unconscious influences, such as culture, family, peers, and media. These forces can impact individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and actions and shape how they interact with others and the environment.

For example, culture plays a significant role in shaping our behavior, since it'shapes our values and beliefs. From the moment of birth, we are taught to act and think in certain ways based on the cultural norms of our society. We learn the conventions of language and communication, the expectations of how to dress and act, and the acceptable social roles. All of these aspects of culture shape our behavior and can be incredibly difficult to unlearn.

Family also shapes our behavior in many ways. From a young age, we are exposed to our parents’ values and beliefs, which often become our own. We learn how to interact with others, how to express ourselves, and how to manage our emotions based on our families’ ways of interacting. We also internalize our parents’ views on gender roles and power dynamics, which can have a lasting influence on our behavior.

Peers can also have a significant impact on our behavior. As adolescents, we seek acceptance from our peers and often mimic their behavior in order to fit in. This can include the way we talk, our fashion choices, the way we spend our free time, and our opinions. We may also engage in risky behavior if we are surrounded by peers who do the same.

Finally, media can shape our behavior in various ways. Advertising and television shows often portray certain types of people in a certain way, which can lead us to believe that is how we should act. We may also internalize the messages of these ads and shows, leading us to believe certain values and follow certain trends.

In conclusion, I believe that people's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making. From culture to family to peers to media, we are constantly exposed to influences that shape how we think, feel, and act. While we have the potential to make conscious choices about our behavior, it is often difficult to resist the external forces that are constantly pushing and pulling us in one direction or another.

"ELECTORAL COLLEGE

I strongly believe that the electoral college is the right way to go. The reason I feel this way is because of the electors, our founding fathers and, political parties.

I like that three electors is representing a state. I believe that the electors know more about the government than regular people. I want someone that knows what they are doing when they go to represent our state! There are 538 electors that vote for president and vice president but there only has to be 270 votes required to elect the president or vice president. Congress has to count the votes in the same place that the electors voted in. Sometimes I don't agree with the president that they picked but I'm glad that honest people count the votes. When the votes are finished and the winner's name is called out the losers revive a certificate of ascertainment.

Also a big part of me wants to keep the electoral college is because of our founding fathers. They put in so much work to help us. I would hate for all there hard work to go to waste. Also they had to put their lives on the line to help crate it. They broke so many laws  for us! Also think about not only did they put their lives in danger but their families life at risk! To me that took a strong amount of courage! I'm honored to talk about our founding farther any time! In the 23 amendment our founding fathers wrote the district of Columbia is allowed three electors and for them to be treated like a state! Also our founding fathers wrote that only citizens that are qualified to vote! Key word here people ''Qualified!'' As long as everyone remembers that key word then, we all should be fine!

I know! I know! A lot of people hate political parties but, I like them. Just think about when you were in school and you wanted to be class president so bad. The people who voted for you is like your political party. I know I loved my political party because they helped me win! Your political party helps come up with all kinds of cool ideas to get people to vote for you. Like when I was running for class president my political party baked cookies, passed out fliers and, help me wright my speech! That's just like when you run for president and vice president. Except I don't think they really pass out cookies when you run to be the real deal president! I know I would vote for the president if he or she gave me a cookie! Ha ha ha ha I crack myself up but it's the truth! Hint Hint for the next election I better be at the top of the list if someone decides to give out cookies!

I agree with the Electoral College because I want what's best for my state, family and, friends!",0,"tensor([[ 0.0361, -0.1653,  0.3548,  ..., -0.5378,  0.6428,  0.4964],

"Unmasking the Face on Mars

If you ever saw or heard about the ""Face on Mars"" you might think that it was created by aliens but it's actually not. Everybody thinks it is but it's really just a natural landform.

A few days after NASA sent a camera up to Mars to look for Viking 2 it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. They said,"" it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It soon become a pop icon and it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and on radio talk shows. Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.

People starting believing that it was evidence of life on Mars. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photo. Everybody was waiting to see it but it revealed that it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Even after having all this evidence people sill didn't believe that it's not an alien because they said the pitcure was cloudy and could've been hidden. To prove everyone wrong, on a cloudless day they took a second photo with even better quality of the landform.

Finally, the picture could show you that it was not really a face but only a landform. Many people just want to believe that there is life on Mars when there most likey is not. They spent a lot of money trying to prove this to everyone that there is no alien life on the planet Mars.",0,"tensor([[-0.6563, -0.2379,  0.1871,  ..., -0.1929,  0.8138,  0.2392],

"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice can be very helpful for a few key reasons:

Firstly, getting perspectives from different people allows you to gather more information to consider. Rather than relying on a single person's point of view or area of expertise, you can learn about a situation or problem from various angles. This exposes you to new factors, context, or solutions that one person alone may not have brought up. With more input and more complete data to contemplate, your decisionmaking will likely be more informed. 

Secondly, multiple viewpoints help balance or moderate any potential biases from a single source. No individual provides a perfectly objective take—everyone sees the world through the lens of their own experiences and prejudices. But bias from one advisor may be caught or counterbalanced by the opinions of others. They can point out holes in each other's logic or assumptions in a way the seeker themself may miss. This interplay of differing analyses leads to a more well-rounded analysis.

Lastly, seeking the counsel of more than one person allows for some consensus building or crossed validation. If most advisors point to the same conclusion or course of action, it suggests that choice has crossed an important threshold of prudence. Or if viewpoints are mixed, it flags that more factors need weighing. Either way, the seeker gains confidence by discerning which recommendations are broadly supported versus idiosyncratic to just one friend or family member. This consensus-validating function further strengthens the quality of the choice made.

In summary, there are sound reasons why running important decisions and requests for advice by multiple trusted individuals provides benefits. It exposes you to more complete information from various angles, counters individual biases, and helps determine which guidance has crossed a threshold of agreed soundness. More perspectives allows for wiser choices overall.",1,"tensor([[-0.3842, -0.5008, -0.3190,  ...,  0.0215, -0.1411,  0.7143],

"Dear Senator [Your Senator's Last Name],

I write to you today to express my thoughts on a pressing issue: the method by which we elect our President. Specifically, I implore you to rally support for maintaining the often-debated Electoral College system.

Our country's founding fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between Congressional election of the President and direct popular vote (Federal Register). They carefully considered the balance between majority rule and protection against mob rule, creating a system to enable broader representation across our diverse nation. Indeed, keeping the Electoral College ensures that between our densely-populated urban areas and sparsely populated rural states, no area’s needs and rights are wholly ignored.

Critics argue that the system is undemocratic, as the President is technically elected by electors, not directly by the individuals (Plumer; Posner). It is true that the system can lead to an outcome where the candidate with the most popular votes nationwide does not win the election, as seen in the year 2000. However, this phenomenon has been exceedingly rare overall.

Detractors also point out the potential for Electoral College crises, including faithless electors, and an electoral tie leading to the House of Representatives determining the election result (Plumer). Yet these situations have been relatively infrequent and largely resolved without causing lasting harm to our democratic processes.

The Electoral College also resolves issues such as what could potentially happen when no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, thus avoiding the need for complicated run-off elections (Posner). More importantly, it forces presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region holds enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This compels candidates to understand and consider the needs of diverse areas across the country, making the eventual winner ""everyone's President"" (Posner).

Admittedly, the system is not perfect. The focus on swing states during the election campaigns leaves some citizens feeling ignored and potentially disinterested in voting (Plumer; Posner). However, as Posner notes, even in a system of popular vote, no single vote ever truly swings a national election.

I urge you, Senator, to deeply consider these points. The Electoral College is an invaluable mechanism that ensures a balanced, fair representation of all states in our presidential elections. It encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse range of constituents and minimizes the complexity of run-offs. This unique system, while not perfect, is deeply embedded in the democratic structure and tradition of our nation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

"There is a lot of debate over whether the government should fund things like theaters and sports stadiums rather than putting more money into medical care and education. There are valid points on both sides, but I believe that the government should fund all of these things.

Medical care and education are both extremely important, and the government should continue to invest in both of these areas. However, I believe that the government should also fund things like theaters and sports stadiums. These places provide people with entertainment and a sense of community. They also bring in tourists, which can boost the economy.

Ultimately, I believe that the government should fund all of these things because they are all important. Medical care and education are vital, but so are places like theaters and sports stadiums.

Character is often said to define who we are as individuals, but should we choose these traits for ourselves or be shaped and molded by outside forces? There is much debate surrounding this issue, and it is important to consider both sides before making a decision.

On the one hand, there are those who believe that character traits should be chosen independently. Self-determination allows us to make our own decisions, and makes us agents of change in our own lives. Moreover, it also allows us to establish our values and follow our own moral compass. By taking this approach, we can be assured that our character is shaped by the person we decide to be. An example of this can be seen in the way people choose to use their resources in different ways to achieve certain goals.

On the other hand, it is argued that character traits should be shaped, in part, by outside influences. External experiences, both good and bad, can shape and influence our character. Culture, family, and other external influences can all contribute to our values and way of life. Proponents of this approach argue that these experiences are necessary in order to help shape and refine our character. An example of this is how people from different cultures have varying perspectives on certain issues.

Ultimately, it is up to us to decide how our character is shaped and molded. We have the freedom of choice and the power to change the course of our lives. We can support positive external influences while maintaining our own autonomy and individuality. As long as we make conscious decisions about our character traits, we can shape our lives in a way that is best for us.

In conclusion, when it comes to our character traits, we have the power to determine our own destiny. We can draw from the values of those that have influenced us, or we can create our own unique character and determine our own fate. It is up to us to decide which approach is best for our lives, and we have the freedom to choose our own character traits.",1,"tensor([[ 0.1534, -0.7429, -0.7447,  ..., -0.0308,  0.1494,  0.7126],

We all have unique personalities and regardless of our similarities, our individual traits are what make us stand out. People can have a bad day for a variety of reasons. Stress, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed can all lead to a poor mood. Additionally, some people may struggle with depression or anxiety. It's important to take the time to recognize the reasons why you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, and tackle the issues head-on. 

First impressions are not necessarily who a person is. People can grow and change over time and they can choose to challenge their first impressions of one another and create deeper relationships. It's important to give people the benefit of the doubt. Spend time getting to know the people you meet and take the time to understand them instead of judging them on a surface level. Together, we can work to prevent snap judgments and build a strong foundation of mutual respect.",1,"tensor([[ 0.2253, -0.2613, -0.4787,  ..., -0.4078,  0.0083,  0.5831],

"Asking people for advice can be hard work. So hard, in fact, that you are tempted to ask only one person. However, this may not be the best option. The most optimal technique for gaining advice is to ask as many people as possible, and to follow the advice that you feel is best. Here is some advice on how to ask for advice:

When seeking advice, turn to who you feel are your most credible sources. Teachers, parents, and trusted adults can all lend you helpful tidbits of information. People usually give advice to you as if they were giving it to their past selves, so advice tends to be full of bias. There are also a lot of many-sided ethical dilemmas that have completely different answers depending on who you ask.

Always follow the advice that makes the most sense to you. When people are throwing their opinions out there, they will usually tell you what works best for them. For example, when asking for advice about how to study, not every tip is going to apply to you, because everyone has different learning styles. You might want to ask many people and only use the advice that you like most, or that you feel would work for you.

If you are too shy about asking for advice, you may be tempted to look on the internet. Do not look on the internet first. Always ask your parents or other trusted adults before embarking on the quest to find advice on the internet. You may find articles written by random strangers who are writing for a much older audience with different needs or wants than you. Since they are writing mostly for everybody, they will not consider everybody's needs, and will speak for the default demographic.

Remember to always ask more than one person for advice, and to follow the advice that you feel would help you the most. Ask parents and trusted adults before consulting anyone else, and especially before consulting the internet. Armed with this new toolkit of knowledge, you are now ready to ask for advice the right way!",0,"tensor([[-0.0116, -0.5364, -0.4659,  ..., -0.0366,  0.0884,  0.6286],

"Dear Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is an unamerican, and unfair voting process. In America we believe in the people living in our country having the right to vote for their leaders, but what if they're not directly voting themselves? The electoral college is an inaccurate way of determining the leaders of our country compared to the other actually accurate way of voting, a direct vote election. The method of The Electoral College cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. This doesn't seem exactly the way things are supposed to be in our nation since ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""source 2, does it?

Though it is highly unlikely that a choosen elector from a state would not vote towards the chosen side their state decided and voted upon, they still have the opportunity to. This opportunity is unfair to the voters of the state as they are not directly voting for the president, such as how things are in a direct vote. A direct vote allows the candidate to be choosen and voted for directly by voters knowladgebly voting, then the highest popularity percentage from votes are then to have the candidate be elected, not by a group of people that have a chance to be bias from the voters in their state. This problem can occur by things such as state legislatures picking electors that may not vote in favor of the states population's choice, but their and state legislatures choice. Even though ""...almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis,..""source 3 not all states electors must do so. They can and have the chance to choose whoever they want as the power to pick is in their hands, and out of ours.

In smaller states such as Hawaii and Alaska they are only given a total of 34 electoral college votes as their population is not as large as somewhere such as California, New York or Florida. This does not only matter due to the low number of votes awarded, but it also effects how much they may know about the candidates running for the position. A lot of candidates only choose to go to ""swing"" states California, New York, etc. in order to recieve more votes in the electoral college. ""...candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning,..""source 2 this causes a lot of people in areas not visited to be unknowledgable about eligible candidates in the voting process, and what they could be voting for. These ""swing"" states help candidates reach their goal of the winning 270 majority votes out of the 538 possible. 538 may seem like a large number but compared to the population of the United States its not really all that large of a group of people. The population of our nation and the votes of our voters is much more larger then the decisions of 538 electors.

Now hopefully it is clearer to see the many problems of the current electoral college system, as it is unfair and irrational. Our nation's voters are the ones who should be voting in a direct vote in picking the president compared to the electoral college. As the method of the electoral college cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. These are only a couple of the large problems caused by the electoral college.",0,"tensor([[-0.1065, -0.1802, -0.0898,  ..., -0.4374,  0.5650,  0.6714],

"The Impact of Social Media on Student Mental Health. In today's world, social media has become an integral part of our lives. From the moment we wake up to the time we go to bed, many people are connected online through various platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. While this technology can be beneficial in connecting us with others around the globe, it can also have many negative impacts - particularly on students' mental health. Social media encourages users to compare their own experiences and accomplishments with those of their peers. This increases feelings of inadequacy and lowers self-esteem when they find themselves lagging behind or not achieving similar results as their peers. Constant exposure to seemingly perfect images posted by friends, celebrities or even strangers can lead students to think that everyone else is living a better life than them leading them into emotional distress like depression or anxiety. Another issue facing student mental health is cyber bullying which occurs both directly (messages sent from one person directly towards another) and indirectly (harmful messages spread about someone). Cyberbullying affects nearly half of all teens between 12-17 years old yearly according to statistics from The American Academy Of Pediatrics . It often goes unpunished due to its anonymous nature but leave long lasting psychological effects for victims such as sadness, anger , fear and even suicidal thoughts . Furthermore there is evidence indicating that teens who use social media more often are at greater risk for being bullied compared with those who don’t use it as much. . Finally spending too much time online has been proven detrimental regarding sleep quality which then leads into lack concentration during school hours thus impacting academic performance negatively . Students nowadays tend t o stay awake late night scrolling through posts , messaging friends etc so fatigue easily sets in during day time affecting learning capabilities drastically . . In conclusion , while social media provides us with exciting new ways to connect with each other quickly & easily , there should be proper regulation by parents & schools alike so that potential harm caused

"The funding of scientific research is a complex issue with a variety of considerations that should be taken into account. On one hand, investing in science can bring about great benefits for humanity, but on the other hand, the consequences of such research can be unpredictable, and the potential for unexpected outcomes should not be overlooked. For this reason, I believe that governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear. 

One of the most compelling arguments for why governments should not fund such research is the potential for unforeseen harm. While it is true that scientific research can be a powerful tool for advancement and positive change, it can also be used to create new technologies or substances with unintended consequences. The atomic bomb is a prime example of this. While it was developed in the hope of ending World War II, the bomb also caused immense destruction and lasting damage to both people and the environment. Similarly, genetic engineering has the potential to produce new medicines and treatments, but it can also lead to the creation of new pathogens or even the accidental release of modified organisms into the wild. The potential for unforeseen harm is just too great to ignore. 

Another reason governments should not fund such research is due to the waste of resources. Financial resources are limited and should be allocated carefully to ensure they are put to the best use. Funding research with unclear consequences could mean that these resources are being used to pursue a project which may not lead to any positive outcome, or which may even lead to harm. It is better to use these resources on projects that have a greater chance of success, or which have a clear purpose and direction. 

Finally, governments should not fund research whose consequences are unclear because it could send the wrong message to the public. By investing in such research, the government could be seen as endorsing potentially unethical or irresponsible behavior, which could lead to a loss of public trust. This is especially true when it comes to research involving genetically modified organisms, which can be controversial and even controversial. If the public perceives such research as being endorsed by the government, it could lead to a backlash and a loss of confidence in the scientific community. 

In conclusion, I believe that governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear. The potential for unforeseen harm, the waste of resources, and the potential loss of public trust are all compelling reasons why governments should take a cautious approach when it comes to funding research. While it is true that scientific progress can bring about great benefits, it is important to remember that it also carries with it potential risks and unknowns.

"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, the Face was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Cydonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took more pictures of the Face. This occured in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that the Face was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that the Face is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find.

"When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend.

"The past and the present are two different worlds. It is natural for people to think that work nowadays is more stressful and less leisurely than in the past. However, this is not always the case.

There are many factors to consider when examining work stress. For example, work hours may have increased, but technology has also made many jobs more efficient and less time-consuming. In addition, people now have more opportunities to take leisurely activities during their free time.

It is true that some jobs are more stressful now than in the past. For example, jobs that require long hours and high levels of responsibility can be very stressful. However, many other jobs are less stressful, due to technological advances and other factors.

Overall, it is hard to say whether work is more or less stressful now than in the past. Each person’s experience is different, and there are many factors to consider. However, I believe that work is generally less stressful now than in the past, due to technological advances and other factors.

"Are you happy the way you vote today, would you be happy if we were to change the way we vote for president. Because they are thinking to change the electroal vote. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it has been doing us good for a long time, and if we do change it, it would take a while for us to get used to it.

The first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him  and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state"" which is in source 3.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.

And thats why I think that we should keep the electoral College because one it hasd been doing us good and it will take us a while to get used to the new voing system.",0,"tensor([[-0.3274, -0.3048, -0.2827,  ..., -0.6237,  0.6674,  0.6309],

"The Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable in classrooms. This device would let teachers understand student feeling better. To which would let the teachers be able to switch up how they teach that student . This device also uses a very reliable computer program to calculate the face muscles. This would make it the most relatable to human facial muscles.

Finally, this device has many benefits to it such as, reading emotional expressions and even telling if there faking that expression.

This use of this technology would benefit teachers by letting them know how the students feel. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions""(D'Alto).For example lets say a student is feeling fustrated on a test, so he might show he's happy so the teacher wont come question him. The teacher can use the FACS device and understand exactly how the student is feeling. Instead of him thinking that the student is happy he could look on the device and it would tell him exactly what he feels and what percent of all the emotions take up. Overall, this Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in the classroom.

Another way this technology is benefical would be the calculations of the muscles of your face. What this means is the device would "" constructs a 3-D computer model of the face""(D'Alto). This model would show your face muscles and it would calculate how the are moved or know as ""action unit"". Then based on the movement of those muscles .The FACS device would list one of the"" six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadeness""(D'Alto). Finally, the last step to FACS device would be to get the results on that perticular person emotions.

In conclusion, this Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to classrooms.

"Texting and driving

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be.

Despite offering huge benefits, cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.

In conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important?

"The Face on Mars: A Natural Phenomenon 

There has been much debate about the unusual landform detected on Mars known as the ""Face on Mars."" Some people claim that it was artificially constructed by an alien civilization. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the Face is simply a result of natural geological processes.  

One line of evidence that supports the Face being natural comes from photos taken at higher resolutions by later Mars probes. These images revealed that what initially looked like distinct features of a face, such as eyes and a mouth, were actually just randomly occurring bumps and indentations that came together to form vague pareidolic patterns that triggered face recognition in observers. Without being able to see fine details, early low-resolution images made patterns that were in fact ambiguous seem deliberately arranged.

Additionally, geological mapping of the area revealed that the layered rock forming the Face's outline is composed of the iron-rich mineral hematite. NASA scientists determined that hematite only forms in the presence of liquid water. Since it is clear that Mars once had large oceans billions of years ago, the hematite layer was most likely deposited as sediment when that region was covered by an ancient ocean. Over time, natural weathering and erosion sculpted this sediment layer into the landform we see today. 

In conclusion, while early images of the ""Face on Mars"" understandably led to speculation of artificial construction, newer evidence overwhelmingly supports the interpretation that it was formed by natural geological processes related to Mars' ancient climate and the presence of liquid water. The vague patterns perceived in its landform can be attributed to the human psychological tendency towards facial pattern recognition rather than any proof of extraterrestrial activity. For these reasons, the scientific consensus is that Mars' famous ""Face"" is simply an interesting accidental configuration formed entirely by natural causes over millions of years.",1,"tensor([[-0.9926, -0.1175, -0.4995,  ...,  0.3818,  0.3934,  0.5481],

"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for 40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new sixyear federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""carfree"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emission. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some overpopulated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog disappeared. London had the idea for evennumbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money because you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for 40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emissions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.",0,"tensor([[-0.0254, -0.2159, -0.1235,  ..., -0.3125,  0.6088,  0.0188],

"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",0,"tensor([[-0.4998,  0.2395, -0.2056,  ..., -0.4281,  0.8669,  0.2582],

"Facial Coding: Valuable or Not

There is a new emotion reader out there, called FACS, short for the Facial Action Coding System. This new application has a bunch of cool features and innovations that can have some pretty practical applications. However, this essay is only focused on one application; is this system beneficial for reading human emotions in a classroom setting? People have mixed feelings about this, but this essay will focus on why this new FACS is not extremely valuable for reading emotional expressions in a classroom setting.

First, what can this new emotion reader do? Well, this thing can read all of the emotions on the face of the Mona Lisa. Not just one or two, but four emotions at once, and balance the percentages for each emotion, to let you know exactly how much of each emotion the person is feeling. This could have some really cool applications, like being able to tell what emotions someone was trying to convey in a drawing, or being able to tell what kinds of things you like or dislike, based off your expressions when you are shown different advertisements. There is so much you can do with this new technology, and there is a lot of uses that it has. However, the things you can do in a school setting are just mediocre.

There is a lot that sounds like cool things you can use this application for in school. In the text it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" The text also says,""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This sounds like a really good thing. However, instead of a computer system having to recognize when a student gets confused or bored, the student can just speak up and say something about it. That is not all, though. The computer system could either, one, misread a student's expression and make the lesson harder to understand or take a lot longer, or two, the student might just start drifting away and thinking about something else that is really confusing, like Einstein's theory of relativity. The computer, in turn, would make the lesson modified when it doesn't need to be, and have so many modifications that the student gets completely lost and doesn't understand anything that is happening in the lesson, just because he or she started to think about something else for a couple of seconds.

Lastly, this facial recognition system could seem like a pretty big invasion of privacy. Do people want everyone to know every single emotion they ever feel? Do they want all their teachers to know that they find what they are talking about boring? No, they do not, at least for the most part. Systems like these are getting pretty close to almost being able to know what someone is thinking, and most people don't want everyone to know what they are thinking about. The text says, ""The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This text says that the system can detect your emotions, but also your mixed emotions. Going back to the Mona Lisa example, the software can track the exact amount of emotions that you have, and the percentages of the emotions that you are feeling. This seems way too much like an invasion of privacy, given that people are giving what their feeling, and all of it too, away to a computer system, that can be tracked or looked at by anyone. Now maybe the system will only give what you are feeling to a teacher, or maybe it will not even do that, and function as a one-on-one learning guide. Even still, their are various ways to get into computer and technological programs, and forcing kids to give away all their emotions just for a possible improved and modified lesson seems like way too much to force someone to do, for that amount of a reward.

So, the FACS could have numerous practical applications for entertainment purposes and other purposes too. However, putting it at use to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom isn't one of them. In conclusion, the use of FACS in a classroom isn't worth the value that comes out of it, as it could have better applications elsewhere, it could glitch out or misread emotions, it could read emotions that the student is feeling about something else rather than the classroom, and finally, an appliclation that can read all of your expressions and convey them to other people is a pretty huge invasion of privacy, and forcing people to use this program is not worth the value of a slightly modified lesson for each individual. In the end, FACS is more useful as an entertainment device rather than having a school setting application.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent times, there has been a growing awareness and concern towards the challenges and issues associated with excessive car usage. From cities like Vauban in Germany to Bogota in Colombia, there are examples of communities that have chosen to limit car usage and witnessed significant improvements in the quality of life and environmental conditions (Rosenthal, Selsky). This essay aims to present a compelling case for limiting car usage by highlighting its advantages including reduced greenhouse emissions, improved public health, and enriched community life, drawing evidence from global initiatives.

There is ample scientific evidence that excessive car usage contributes significantly to the global greenhouse gas emissions, thereby fueling the climate change crisis. In fact, passenger cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). Additionally, cities that favor car usage frequently contend with smog and poor air quality, as demonstrated by situations in Paris (Duffer). Prioritizing alternative modes of transport reduces our dependence on cars, contributing substantially to mitigating climate change. 

The public health benefits of limiting car usage are substantial. Cities with fewer cars have been shown to have lower levels of air pollution, thereby contributing to improvements in respiratory health among its citizens. This assertion gets further substantiated by the partial driving ban in Paris, which reduced congestion by 60% to contain the smog crisis (Duffer). Moreover, transforming cities to be less car-dependent also promotes physical activity such as walking or cycling, thereby combating sedentary lifestyles, and their associated health concerns such as obesity and heart disease. Bogota's ""Day Without Cars"" is a testament to this, where millions participated, engaging in physically active modes of transportation (Selsky). 

Lastly, reduced car usage fosters enriched community life, leading to quieter, safer, and more vibrant local neighborhoods. The suburb of Vauban in Germany, where 70% of the families do not own cars, is an excellent illustration of this, where the streets echo with the sound of children and bicycles rather than motor engines (Rosenthal). Also, urban design that favours reduction in car usage usually involves allocating more space for parks, social centers and broad, smooth sidewalks, enhancing the infrastructure for community interactions (Selsky). 

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage go beyond environmental protection to include health benefits and enhanced community life. As emphasized by sociologist Mimi Sheller, the trend of America's cooling love affair with vehicles signals a long-term cultural shift (Rosenthal). While it is true that cars can provide convenience and flexibility, it is important to weigh these benefits against the wider societal and environmental impacts. As citizens, it is our collective responsibility to support and advocate for policies and practices that promote alternative modes of transportation, not only for our sake but also for future generations.",1,"tensor([[-0.6373, -0.0156, -0.7197,  ..., -0.4256,  0.6159, -0.3649],

"Hi my name is Jhon, and i'm i scientist of the NASA, i'm writing this because a lot of people and scientists are argueing about the Face on Mars, some people say that the face i created by some kind of ancient civilization or aliens. i don't just think that the Face on Mars is not crated by aliens, i'm sure that the Face on Mars is not creted by aliens or any kind of ancient civilization and the reason of why i'm writing this is because i want to prove you that the Face on Mars is there for natural reasons.

The first reason to prove you that i'm correct and that the Face on Mars in not crated for aliens is that on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camara's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. As a rule of thump you can dicern things ina digital image 3 times bigger than a pixel size, if there were objects in this picture like houses airplain or any oter object you coold se what they were!. The Face on Mars has become a pop icon, some people thinkt he Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would hide, that is what conspiracy theorists say, NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

That is all i have to say, i hope now you understand that the Face on Mars is just there for natural reasons and that is not crated for aliens or any kind of ancient civilization because i think that the information that i gave you is really interesting and true. i hope you believe me and thank you for your time, and for eading this.",0,"tensor([[-0.4393, -0.1311, -0.2447,  ..., -0.5416,  0.6900,  0.2327],

"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps reduce smog in the cities. In the article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", the author, Robert Duffer, talks about France banned driving in order to clean the polluted air. According to the text, "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"". Here it is evident that Paris has major pollution problems. Most of the vehicles in Paris have diesel fuel rather than gasoline, in which they favor due to a tax policy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party"". This clearly shows us that the ban on driving in Paris had an advantage in keeping a clean air.

Not only will limiting car usage will maintain an polluted air for us to breathe, but it will decrease traffic jams. In the article, ""Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, a program is to ""promote alternative transportation"". Selsky writes, ""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". This tells the reader that this has positive impact on the city.

Limiting car usage could save time, improve safety, and conserve resources. According to the article, ""The End Of Car Culture"", the author mentions how her children live in places in which driving a car would be useful, however its not their priority because they ""organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"". Although they could have gotten their own license to drive, it would have been a waste of money and time when there is always an avaliable and less cost transportaion.

Limiting car usages indeed does have advantages. The limiting of our car usages has positive effect on our enviroment by the reducing of smog, the decrease in traffic jams, conserves our resources and time, and also improves our safety.",0,"tensor([[-0.3297, -0.3528, -0.0891,  ..., -0.4902,  0.4457, -0.0257],

"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family.

You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do.

Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good.

And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind.

Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle

Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Name's family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Name's family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Name's family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them.

In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

"I honestly can not say for sure if or if not there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are right now. However, I do know that the number of cars on the road today is far greater than it has ever been in the history of the United States. In fact, it is more than double what it was in 1900.

What do you think is the most important reason for the increase in car use? I think the biggest reason is that we are living longer than we ever have before. The average life expectancy for a man is now over 80 years old. That is a lot of time to spend driving around in a car. We are spending more time in our cars than ever before, and that is not necessarily a good thing. There are many reasons for this, but one of them is because we have become so dependent on cars for our transportation needs. If we had to walk or take public transportation to get to work or school, we would not be spending so much time driving to and from work and school. It is also important to remember that cars are not the only form of transportation that people use. People also walk, bike, take the bus, ride the train, drive their own cars, or use a combination of all of these methods. For example, if you live in an urban area, you are more likely to be walking or biking to your job than you would be driving your car to the job. This is especially true for people who are older and have lower incomes. They are less likely than younger people to have cars and are therefore more vulnerable to being injured or killed by a driver who is distracted or impaired by alcohol or drugs. Another reason people are using cars more often than they used to is due to economic conditions. Many people have lost their jobs or have been forced to take lower paying jobs in order to make ends meet. As a result, they cannot afford to buy a new car, so they have to use their current car as long as they can until they are able to find another job or find a better paying job that does not require driving. Finally, many people do not have the time or money to maintain their cars. Cars are expensive to own and maintain, especially when you consider the fact that you need to pay for gas,

"The United Nations' Role in International Conflict Resolution. In today's world, international conflicts are becoming increasingly common. To address the growing threat of these conflicts, the United Nations (UN) plays an integral role in resolving them. Established in 1945 with a mission of maintaining peace and security throughout the world, the UN operates through its various organs to mediate disputes and develop lasting solutions to conflict management issues. In order for successful resolution efforts to take place within international conflicts, effective communication between warring parties is essential. This is where the UN's multifaceted approach comes into play. Through its Diplomatic Missions and Special Envoys, it works towards establishing meaningful dialogue between conflicting states that seek to ultimately reach peaceful agreements on contentious matters such as border disputes or human rights violations; this has been incredibly valuable in ensuring that all sides are heard and respected during negotiations. The Security Council also plays a critical role by issuing resolutions tailored specifically towards each particular dispute while providing support from member countries if needed; this ensures that any agreement reached will be followed through on by both parties involved without fear of retribution or retaliation from other states not directly involved in their specific conflict. Additionally, various UN entities have implemented tools aimed at curbing violence during times of unrest and preventing further escalation of existing tensions; among these include Arms Embargoes which work to limit access to certain types of weapons as well as Peacekeeping Forces which can be deployed when wars threaten global stability or humanitarian crises arise due to prolonged combat situations. It is widely accepted that having a strong international body like the UN overseeing complex diplomatic arrangements has helped bring about more equitable solutions than could ever have been achieved independently by individual nations alone over time - thus proving itself invaluable when it comes to preserving global peace and security while simultaneously promoting economic development around the world too!. . It is undeniable that ongoing progress must be made if we wish for truly lasting outcomes regarding international conflict resolution initiatives - yet there can be no

"Computer games are loved by children and Adults alike. The reason why they are so popular is mainly because they are a great way for children to learn new things and have fun. However, some people think that computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's physical, intellectual as well as psychological development. Consequently, they suggest that effective measures should be taken to prevent children from playing them.

One of the most common problems that computer games can cause is that they can be very addictive. Children who are addicted to computer games often find it hard to break the habit. This can lead to them spending more and more time playing the game, which can cause them to lose touch with reality. It also can make them less motivated to learn or do other things.

Another common problem is that computer games can be very dangerous. Children who play computer games often do not know what they are getting themselves into. They can become very injured or even killed. This can have a very negative effect on their development, both physically and mentally.

Most of the people who argue that computer games have negative effects on children's development are not actually children themselves. They are adults who have already had some experience with computer games. These people are usually people who are not interested in helping children grow up healthy and happy.

One of the best ways to prevent children from playing computer games is to make sure that they are not really interested in them. This can be done by education. It is also important to make sure that the games that children play are not too dangerous. If they are, then they should be removed from the classroom.

Finally, it is important to remember that computer games are not the only things that can be bad for children. Other things that can also have a negative effect on their development include television, books, and other forms of communication. Therefore, it is important that parents be aware of the dangers that computer games pose to their children.

"The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read student emotions in the classroom could provide both benefits and challenges. On one hand, it may help teachers better understand how their students are responding to lessons in real-time. If a teacher notices many students expressing confusion or frustration, they could adjust their approach to improve clarity and engagement. This technology could also assist in identifying students who need additional social or emotional support. However, using FACS to constantly monitor student emotions may invade their privacy and feel oppressive. Young people need spaces to freely explore their thoughts and feelings without surveillance. Additionally, facial expressions do not always accurately convey one's true internal state. A blank expression may mask complex thinking, and nervousness could be misread as disinterest. Before implementing such technology, schools would need strong privacy protections and teacher training to avoid misinterpretations. On balance, FACS could enhance learning if its insights supplement - rather than replace - a teacher's understanding of individual students developed through close interaction over time. Strict guidelines would be required to ensure its use improves education without compromising student well-being or autonomy.",1,"tensor([[-0.2131, -0.3270, -0.2507,  ..., -0.2586, -0.6380,  0.6808],

"cars are everywhere these days, and they are commonplace among us. getting from point a to point i almost always involves using a car. iut there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is puilic transportation. there are many ienefits to puilic transportation including reducing emissions, having less cars on the road, and improving cities. this one farfetched idea is now coming into the spotlight.

in cities like chicago and new york, the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air. the main contriiuting source come from emissions from cars. limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution from filling the air. the quality of life would then ie much ietter in these cities. ""after days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ian to clear the air of the gloial city."" paris needed to ian cars iecause the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand. if there were fewer cars in the city, this type of proilem would never ie an issue here or around the world.

traffic is always a iig issue on the roads around the united states and the world. limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer. when the car ian was in place in paris ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" when less cars were out on the road, accidents would ie greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in chicago, illinois would ie much more manageaile. there would ie more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestine condition for longer amounts of time. events like carfree day have already had iig impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would ie even greater in larger countries such as the united states. ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" having less cars on the road would ienefit our society in more ways than one.

quite a few years ago, ideas such as puilic transportation iecoming mainstream seemed pretty farfetched. well today, those ideas can help iuisnessses and whole towns limit car usage. when cars are used less frequently, the areas that have more frequent usage will ie cared for even more. new sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping will emerge throughout cities and ie a huge advantage. caring for roads have little ienefit and putting money into puilic areas will help out cities tremendously. ""parks and sports centers also have iloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have ieen replaced iy iroad, smooth sidewalks. new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" using puilic transportation instaid of cars will greatly improve cities.

cars have ieen around for a long time and have served us for many years. now, reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viaile option iecause emissions will ie reduced, there will ie less cars on the road, and cities would ie improved. this task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do iut the infrastructure for it is already in place. puilic transportation is already in larger cities such as new york and chicago and it can easily ie installed in smaller towns and communities. the advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconveniences. smart planning is the iest option to encompass all of these ideas.

Technology impacts the lives of people around the world in countless ways, both positive and negative. In positive terms, technology can be a lifeline in emergency situations, allowing those in need to get the help they need quickly. It can also help to shape attitudes, providing access to information the average person would not have had in years past. On the downside, too much reliance on the virtual world can create an imbalance in people's lives, causing them to prioritize spending time online over spending time in the physical world. People can become so accustomed to virtual connection that they may struggle to form meaningful relationships with people in their own community. Ultimately, technology can be a force for good, provided it is used responsibly and in moderation.",1,"tensor([[ 0.4247, -0.1877, -0.2288,  ..., -0.2850, -0.2059,  0.6669],

"Dear State Senator

My name is Mikayla and I am very concerned about how my president should be elected for the United States. It would be nice to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States , not keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair and should not be used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College has it's issues to why it shouldn't be used to elect the president of the United States. Well for one the Electoral College system ""voters vote not for the president , but for a state of electors , who in turn elect the president."" In paragraph 10, sentence 4 it states that electors ""sometimes"" get confused. Why is that you ask? well because the people are picking the wrong candidates.

The electoral college is also unfair to voters. I say this because of the winner take all system in each state. in paragraph 13 , In paragraph 2 it states that canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , they focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Personally i wouldn't want to use something like that if its unfair , outdated , and irrational.

We should change the election to popular vote for The President. Why you ask? good question. Well because that way it can be fair and reasonable. And let's not forget the voters wouldn't get confused.

The electoral college should be abolished forever. We should continue from now on by changing to election by popular vote for the president. Popular vote would be fair and everyone would love it.",0,"tensor([[-0.1536, -0.3110, -0.0644,  ..., -0.5657,  0.6860,  0.5741],

"Hey dear employees.

I'm writing this letter to tell you about some of my characteristics that are needed for this kind of job. I'm a responsible guy, who likes to be able to help the others if they need help in anything. Also I'm a hard worker because I'm constantly doing work, never stopping to do anything else if I'm not do with my work.

First,I think that I'm a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until I'm done with it. A lot of people tells me that I should get this kind of job, because I dont like when people are irresponsible and since I'm a responsible worker the rest of employers will like how I work, then they will start to their work just like I'm doing mine. I'm always on time. I'm always trying to able to do all the work and to help the others if they don't know how to do it. If I want to go out and be with friends, the first thing that I tell them is that I have to finish my work if I have time to go out after work then I will be able to go with them, but if Im not done then I cant go, because the job is the first thing that we all should have in mind, then the second thing are friends, free time, all that kind of stuffs.

Second, I'm a hard worker in any job, because I like to demonstrate that I can do the best and any job at anytime. So if you need that type of employee I think I'm the right person, because I will work very hard to finish the job by one day. I don't like to many works to be doing at the same time, so I try to finish one per day so later on I wont have to come and start to do the same work I was supposed to finish the day before. Like I said I like to work hard, to finish everything by the same day. I like to make other people work hard to, not just me, because if we all work hard we are all going to be successful in this job, I'm not trying to be successful by myself, I like to see more people success in life. A lot of employees dont work hard for the job that they have, if they dont work hard, that makes the company or the rest of workers look bad because he doesn't want to do anything. That's what I'm trying to change in this job. I'm trying to get this job because I know that I can help other people succeed, I can make this work by helping others and by working hard every day.

In conclusion. I think this are good reasons why I would be a good candidate to be hire for this job, I'm here trying to get this job, so I can help the others to be good workers and help the company look better, because we will work hard and be responsible to make the best out of the best.

"The "" "" seems to be a very aggravating phrase for an entire population of people who have become so dependent on it. It's a concept that we can't take in. We Americans use our cars for a personal use daily. We are so accustomed to our cars that we just use it to perform simple tasks that we could use our legs that were given to us, for free, to cross the street. When the average person says that they would like to go to the market across the street, probably about 70%, don't even think about the fact that we could just simply walk there. Cars are enlarging our environment and our health. Cars create so much pollution and is a healthrisk. Our cars seem to be as important as one of our limbs. Something you could not bare to live without. Now here are some of the reasons why.

To begin with, cars are polluting our atmosphere. Have you ever heard of the ""green house effect""? It's endangering our Earth, by polluting it, which is contributing to Global Warming. Cars are something we shouldn't always rely on. We have to get accustomed to the way of the pioneers. We all just need to limit the amount of times we use our cars and think, ""hmm.. do i really need to use my car right now? Can't i just use my two working legs to get to where i want to go, which is right down the block."" In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5 lines 69, the article states that, and i quote, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas of the United States."" Which is a whole lot of damage we are inflicting our own environment that we need to thrive on and live off. In reality, cars are overrated. We don't always need it, so we shouldn't always use it.

In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 12 lines 13, it states, ""congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5days of intensifying smog."" Imagine all of that pollution on this earth if we kept using our cars, which are slowly killing us.

Not only do cars endanger our environment, but it also creates a huge healthrisk factor.

Cars can make us become lazy. We can use our cars so much to the point where we could get accustomed to cars and grow tired and weary of using our legs. We may as well just live in a car. Cars could also create lots of stress. In artcile ""Carfree day is spinning a big hit in Bogota."", paragraph 5 lines 12, the author interviews someone and that person claims that, "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower airpollution."" In Conclusion, we together as a whole should limit our car usage to cut back on pollution. We should all learn to be in touch with our environment and to just walk around in our clean, ecofriendly air. If we cut back, we wouldn't have to be worried about Global Warming anymore. We would all be closer, one step at a time.",0,"tensor([[-0.1443,  0.0246, -0.1301,  ..., -0.3912,  0.6529,  0.1540],

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. As seen in the passage set, various cities and communities have implemented measures to reduce car dependency, resulting in positive outcomes such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable and efficient transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the passage, passenger cars account for a substantial portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, either through car-free zones or car-free days, emissions can be greatly decreased, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. For example, the article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how implementing a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transit. By creating car-free zones or designing communities with accessibility to public transportation, individuals are encouraged to use these more sustainable options. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides health benefits, as active modes of transportation like walking and biking promote physical activity. In the article about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, it is mentioned how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the development of more compact and walkable communities. Instead of relying on vast amounts of land for parking spaces and sprawling suburbs, smart planning can create neighborhoods with amenities within walking distance. This approach, as demonstrated in the German suburb of Vauban, leads to a higher quality of life, reduced dependence on cars, and a stronger sense of community. The article describes how Vauban’s streets are completely car-free, with car ownership limited to a few designated parking areas. As a result, a significant percentage of residents do not own cars and have reported feeling happier and less stressed.

In addition to the environmental and social benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. The passage on the end of car culture highlights that recent studies suggest Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior can lead to lower carbon emissions and reduce the need for extensive highway infrastructure, saving costs in the long run. Moreover, it opens up opportunities for business innovation, such as car-sharing programs and alternative modes of transportation like bike-sharing. These new business models can create jobs and drive economic growth while providing people with affordable and convenient transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, society, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, creating walkable communities, and stimulating economic growth, the limitations on car usage can lead to a healthier, more sustainable, and more enjoyable way of life. As demonstrated in the passage set, various cities and communities around the world are already implementing these measures and experiencing the benefits firsthand. It is crucial for fellow citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that encourage the reduction of car dependency for the betterment of our future.",1,"tensor([[-0.2476, -0.4090, -0.4191,  ..., -0.0044,  0.3435, -0.1128],

"As human beings, we are constantly building on the knowledge and experiences of those who came before us. In any field of endeavor, it is impossible to make a significant contribution without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field. In this essay, I will argue that while we are free to innovate and create new things, it is inevitable that our creations will build upon previous work in the field.

First, it is important to acknowledge that no one exists in a vacuum. We are products of our environment and the experiences that we have had. As a result, our ideas and creations are shaped by the work of others. For example, the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell was made possible by the earlier work of many scientists and inventors who worked on the development of telegraphy and electrical communication. Bell's invention was not entirely original, but rather an improvement upon existing technologies.

Second, past achievements in a field often provide a foundation upon which new ideas can be built. For example, the field of mathematics has seen many great achievements throughout history, including the development of calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. These achievements provided the foundation for many subsequent advances in fields such as physics and engineering. Without the work of Newton and Leibniz, it is unlikely that these fields would have advanced as far as they have.

Third, our understanding of the world is constantly evolving. New discoveries and ideas are built upon existing knowledge. For example, the field of medicine has seen many great achievements over the years, from the discovery of vaccines to the development of new surgical techniques. These achievements were made possible by the work of those who came before us, and have contributed to our current understanding of the human body and how to treat disease.

In conclusion, it is impossible to make a significant contribution in any field of endeavor without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field. While we are free to innovate and create new things, our creations are inevitably built upon the work of others. This is not a limitation, but rather an opportunity to build upon the achievements of those who came before us and to push the boundaries of what is possible. By doing so, we can continue to advance our understanding of the world and make new discoveries that will benefit future generations.

"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject for several reasons. First, having a broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives. For example, a person who specializes in history may only see the world through the lens of history, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may see the world through the lens of history, math, science, and so on. This broader perspective can help people make better decisions and understand the world around them better.

Second, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more creative. For example, a person who specializes in history may only be able to think of history-related ideas, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to come up with history-related ideas, math-related ideas, science-related ideas, and so on. This broader creativity can help people come up with new solutions to problems and be more innovative.

Third, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more well-rounded. For example, a person who specializes in history may only know a lot about history, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may know a lot about history, math, science, and so on. This broader knowledge can help people communicate with others more effectively and understand different points of view.

Fourth, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help people be more successful in their careers. For example, a person who specializes in history may only be able to find a job as a history teacher, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to find a job as a history teacher, a math teacher, a science teacher, and so on. This broader knowledge can help people be more versatile and adaptable in the workforce.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives, be more creative, be more well-rounded, and be more successful in their careers.

Modern science is beginning to recognize the benefits that certain medicinal plants can bring for those struggling with mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety, and even addiction. One group of medicinal plants commonly used to treat mental illness are adaptogens. Adaptogens are herbs that help the body cope with physical and psychological stressors by increasing its resistance to them. They work differently than pharmaceutical drugs because they don't target specific systems or conditions but rather provide broad support for overall well-being. Popular examples include ashwagandha, holy basil (tulsi), maca root, ginseng and reishi mushroom extract. These act on multiple levels helping reduce inflammation while providing calming effects, improving moods and restoring balance within our bodies’ various physiological functions like hormone production or immune system functioning– all essential when dealing with mental illness like depression or anxiety disorders. Herbal teas made from these plant extracts have also been found effective at aiding relaxation which helps improve sleep quality – another important factor in managing emotional distress associated with certain forms of mental illness like PTSD or bipolar disorder where disturbed sleep patterns may contribute to episodes of mania or depression respectively. Furthermore research shows that aromatic oils extracted from select species such as chamomile flower oil produce powerful anti-inflammatory action on our brain cells; this not only helps relieve symptoms related to existing conditions but could also potentially prevent their onset altogether through regular supplementation routines over time!. . Lastly herbal medicine can be very cost effective compared traditional treatments which often require costly medications plus therapists fees etc.so it's an attractive alternative both financially & emotionally speaking since many people prefer taking more ‘natural’ routes when tackling their ailments instead relying heavily upon complex pharmacological solutions alone– something worth considering if you're looking

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College: A System Worth Retaining

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system or, at the very least, the need to consider the advantages it offers before making any decision regarding a potential change to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided by various sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is crucial for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite its flaws in the past, such as the 2000 election, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents any prolonged disputes over the election outcome and provides a clear path towards determining the winner of the presidency. In contrast, if we were to switch to a popular vote system, a dispute over the results would be much more likely, as seen by historical examples.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in electing the president. This system encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and prevents regional favorites from dominating the election. By requiring candidates to focus on swing states, the Electoral College guarantees that the interests of different regions are considered. Moreover, it promotes candidates who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that big states do not dominate the election process. By awarding electoral votes based on the size of the state's population, it balances the political power between large and small states. A victory in a closely contested large state, such as Florida, carries more weight in the Electoral College, which encourages candidates to pay attention to the needs and concerns of voters in those states. This ensures a more balanced representation of the interests of both small and large states.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This is particularly important as run-off elections would complicate the process and create additional challenges. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College enables a smoother and more efficient presidential election process.

Lastly, maintaining the Electoral College does not discourage voters who believe their vote may not directly impact the election outcome. Research suggests that voters in presidential elections are more interested in expressing their political preferences rather than considering their individual vote as a deciding factor. Moreover, the Electoral College still drives a significant number of eligible American citizens to participate in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, although imperfect, plays a vital role in ensuring a fair and balanced presidential election process. Its benefits, such as providing certainty of outcome, representing the interests of diverse regions, preventing dominance by big states, and avoiding run-off elections, make it a system worth retaining. I urge you to consider these advantages before making any decisions regarding potential changes to the Electoral College or a switch to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons before forming a stance on this important matter. I look forward to your continued efforts in serving our state and our nation effectively.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.4403, -0.3277, -0.5365,  ..., -0.1570,  0.3016,  0.8629],

"Today a fair amount of humans is very much likely use to being on their cellular device daily. As multiple years pass by technology becomes more and more common. Common enough for individuals to believe it's appropriate to be on their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Unfortunately, cell phones have overall become a huge distraction, especially while operating a vehicle. Driving should not be able to use cell phones under no circumstance due to innocent lives being put at risk, setting a bad example for children, and a higher chance of having a high insurance bill.

To begin with, when making the decision of being on your phone while driving not only are you putting yourself at risk your also putting other innocent lives at risk. Putting only yourself in danger is one thing but outing other in danger is another. As little as just glancing at one text you're selfishly putting an innocent individual in danger. Which demonstrates why one peek off the road can cause such a distraction. However, while making these bad decisions children around you are slowly picking up to your actions.

Secondly, driving and texting can set a bad example for the children watching. Now and days young ones are very observing, which cause them to catch on to things fast and think it's okay to do certain things. Very often you could be driving with younger individuals. While driving with these individuals your most likely older, meaning you should be a role model to them. Portraying that driving and being on your phone is wrong and shouldn't be done, so if you won't drive and be on your phone then younger ones will pick up on that and also won't.

Last but not least, driving and being on your phone has a possibility of increasing your car insurance. Since the hands free law has been strongly enforced so many individuals have been complaining about high insurance knowing they have been pulled over for being on their phone. Of course nobody likes high insurance if you haven't heard it from your mother yet. In fact, high insurance rates can be prevented simply by just waiting to answer that call or text. To help others out there is a driving mode that you can put on your phone to prevent you from being distracted from the rode.

All in all, driving while occupying a vehicle should not be allowed to prevent putting innocent individuals at risk, setting a horrible example for the minors around you, and to prevent high insurance rates. Overall driving and being on a cellular device is a huge distraction in our society as of today. Just one simple glance off the rode can suddenly change your life in a horrific way. Just taking a phone call is dangerous enough, so imagine texting. Take time in your day and remember if that text or call is worth your life before picking up your phone behind the wheel.",0,"tensor([[ 0.3203, -0.2967, -0.1805,  ..., -0.3578,  0.5652,  0.0997],

I says that NASA does more studying they are going to sent people to study Venus. while, they are studying for Venus they can float around Venus and see it around and how it looks like. In paragraph 7 it says,"" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" NASA has been trying to study Venus for a long time and they are trying to approach it so they are sending people to study Venus and they have made some inventions. They have been sending it with people that are going to venus and trying it out. NASA is trying to do something with computers called Mechanical Computers. These computer are going to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. The computer are going to be more better than out computer and phones.

"I agree that successful people try new things and take risks. One reason why is because it allows them to learn and grow. If they only stick to what they know how to do well, they may not be able to learn new skills or find new opportunities. For example, if someone is a salesperson, they may not be able to learn how to cook or sew if they only focus on their sales career.

Another reason why successful people try new things and take risks is because it allows them to be more creative. If they only stick to what they know, they may not be able to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. For example, if someone is a businessperson, they may not be able to come up with new marketing strategies if they only focus on their business goals.

Finally, successful people try new things and take risks because it allows them to be more flexible. If they only stick to what they know, they may not be able to adapt to changes in their environment or to new challenges that arise. For example, if someone is a doctor, they may not be able to adjust to a new hospital if they only focus on treating patients in their previous hospital.

"The advantages of limiting car usage result in a healthier environment for you and your children, exercise by walking or riding a bike, and saving money on parking and gas.

Limiting car usage would be beneficial for the environment because the gas wouldn't polute the air. Green house gas emissions from tailpipes polute the air that everyone is breathing. If the car usage was limited, then the air would start to become fresh again. Stated in the passage, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This exerpt from the passage ""Car-Free Cities"" explains that Europe's percentage is too high and they need to drop it fast or the percentage will grow and the greenhouse gas emissions will increase.

Limiting car usage isn't a big move like most people are making it out to be. Walking to pick up your child from school isn't such a bad thing! It gives you bonding time to spend with them outdoors. You can walk or ride a bike to the park to play. Especially if it is less than 1 mile! Walking is a great way to exercise and its free! FREE!  This component of ""smart planning"" could work if eveyone helped by reducing car use.

Having a car is expensive! You have to pay for gas, which is expensive, and you have to pay to park your car! If you live in the area where you want to go, walk! But if you're going to the grocery store, obviously you would take your car if you're getting a lot at the store. You have to pay to park in the parking garage and that is $40,000 with a house. The passage ""Car-Free Cities,"" states that ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here."" In that town, everything is pretty close to each other so you don't have to drive anywhere. If you needed to go visit a family member in a different city, the the train! It's fun, free, and calming.

As you can see, you don't need to drive a car. Yes, you can drive a car, but why would you? You have buses, and trains, and other ways of transportation. This way, you don't have to pay for gas to go to the park. Not using your car is healthy for the environment and it's great exercise. It's a good way to get outdoors and have a nice walk. So please, just try using your car a little bit less everyday and soon enough, you will rarely use it, the air will be fresh, and you'll be taking some nice strolls in the park with your family.",0,"tensor([[-0.1646, -0.1725,  0.2960,  ...,  0.0142,  0.3445,  0.2458],

"The Electoral College is broken, and with another election on the way, here is why the voting should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged, as well as ""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.

In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. This cannot represent the will of the people.

Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.

The Electoral College dosen't hear the voice of the people, hardly plays by the rules, is something that should be erased. Even people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dale, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree, give the voice back to the people and abolish the Electoral College!",0,"tensor([[-0.5254, -0.1706, -0.1244,  ..., -0.5116,  0.9315,  0.4865],

"Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

"PHONES AND DRIVING

Every year the world loses about 3000 to 6000 people for the use of cellphones while driving. This of course including innocent families including children,adults, and elders.

Many things cause distractions to a person behind the wheel, most of the time the distractions are caused by cellphones. Whether it is a text message , a call, GPS, or justy quickly changing the music ,in those quick little glimpses at your phone you are immediately putting at risk the life of the people around you ,including your own. Driving a vehicle of any kind takes a large amount of responsibility in many ways.

There are many people who are careful of everyone including themselves and have the responsibility and knowledge to keep their phone put away until it is safe to use it again,without putting anybody at risk. But yet there are as many if not more people who either don't care or don't think ahead of what using their cellphone while driving could do,most of these people are teens who think of it as something that doesn't have that much importance . People should not use a cellphone while driving for the simple reason that it is safer to do so,for the sake of your life and the other people around you.

The use of a cell phone while driving a vehicle could not only cause deaths it can cause a person the chance to ever walk again,write again,see ,hear,smell, or even move at all. It can leave children with no parents,family ,with no one to turn to but the government to find a new family and these children will forever live with the pain of knowing that the irresponsibility of their own or someone else caused them their lives. These tragedies do not only affect the people in the vehicle(s),it also affects their family members,friends,neighbors ,the people who were close to them are also affected ,in a great part,emotionally.

The use of cellphones while operating a car needs to stop because it is costing people their lives and chances at many things in life. Not only teens but adults make this mistake as well.",0,"tensor([[-0.0174,  0.2260, -0.0406,  ..., -0.5200,  0.4543,  0.2847],

"When making a decision, sometimes you need to get some advice, but you might not see why that's helpful. Advice is when you take suggestions or ideas from someone about a certain decision you have to make. Whether it's from a friend or family member, advice can help in many ways. The main benefits you get from getting advice are that you see another perspective, you experience varying opinions on the subject, and you see other solutions.

Getting another perspective can be helpful when making a decision because you get to see the issue or decision through someone else's eyes. Opening your mind to new ideas and opinions can help you become a more accepting and kind person, just from this one experience. You might have one opinion your whole life, but if you experience the situation from someone else's point of view, you can see that you might have been wrong. Additionally, even if you don't change your mind because of another person's points or opinions, you still are able to accept their ideas without it bothering you that you disagree. From doing this one small thing, you can figure out how to solve your problem, and you can develop as a person, which is always a good idea, regardless of the circumstance.

You should always seek help from multiple people because it can be even more helpful than getting just one person's opinion. If you get advice from three friends, they will probably all have different answers. However, after hearing those answers, you can debate the different pros and cons of each, and, eventually, you can come to a final conclusion. Whether your solution is one of theirs or some kind of combination, you were helped by asking for multiple opinions. Also, hearing various opinions can open you up to more perspectives, which benefits you in the ways previously stated.

Seeing those other people's opinions can also lead you to see other solutions to your problem. No one has to be wrong or have the wrong opinion, so when you get the opportunity to think about other solutions, it can benefit you and maybe others. For example, if you need a new frying pan, you might think you should just go buy one from the store, but your friend could have another idea. Let's say they have two frying pans, but they only need one. If you ask for their advice, they would suggest that you should have one of theirs as they don't need or want it. Because of this, you would save money and find a solution to your problem, while also helping a friend in cleaning up their kitchen. That solution benefits both of you, showing just how helpful advice can be.

In conclusion, getting advice is always a good idea as it opens you up to new perspectives, differing opinions, and more solutions. New perspectives can open up your mind to help you not only solve your problem, but to be a better person. Also, seeing more solutions can benefit you and possibly others. And finally, getting differing opinions can help you see all sides of the argument, so you can make the right decision. From thinking about these three points, you can see that there are no downsides to asking for advice, especially from multiple people.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1622, -0.5764, -0.4121,  ..., -0.0400,  0.2298,  0.4732],

"imagine a world, twenty or so years from now, completely free of any nature. there is not a single tree, bush, flower or even a blade of grass to be found. only concrete roads and dirt everywhere, along with our cars driving on them. in the cars are us, fat lazy people sitting in our cars, irritated and hollering out profanity at the mile long row of traffic as we try to get ot work. the cause of all this is toxic gases emitted by our cars. this is our future. do we really want this to happen to us and ouur beautiful planet earth? i know i don't, and thats why all around the world, cities and even entire countries are doing something about it, they are working on cutting back peoples' vehicle usage, or even eliminating it. without the cars, there would be a drastic decrease in pollution, peoples' physical health would improve, and no more stress.

we all use cars, it has become a daily thing for all of us. we have become so accustomed to driving that we don't even think about it. we never thought about just how much damage our cars were doing on our home, planet earth. cars are the leading source of pollution, everyday the pollution is ripping away at our ozone layer, slowly dooming us all and we are defiantly feeling the heat from it. places such as Vauban, Germany, have given up cars completely. in this experimental district, street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden and, except for the main thoroughfare, the streets are completely car free. thanks to this, greenhouse gases in this area have gone down. residents of this town don't even seem to mind the car free life, they even enjoy it. having clean air makes this district a beautiful place to live in.

not having motor vehicles also can improve physical health. humans, especially Americans, have become incredibly lazy, and as a result, incredibly fat. no one has time in their busy schedule to excessive. everyone is too busy with work, school, kids, chores, or anythinng else. but, if we all got rid of cars and people either walked to and from their destinations, we would all be losing weight, be more aactive and be so muuch helthier. also, the helthier you are, the longer you live, so getting rid of cars will increase your life span!

having a car can also mean having a lot of stress. theres traffic backing you up making you an hour late for work, high gas prices sucking all the money out nof your wallets, expensive repair prices, and you are always putting your life at risk if you get into an accident. all this to think about while your just trying to get from point A to point B can be very stress full. but if everyone walked or biked to and from wherever, there would be much less traffic, no need for gas, the only repairs you would have to get is pumping more air in your tires, the onnly accident you might have is runninng your bike into another's bike and as long as you wear the right protectionn gear, you are very safe.

all of these factors add up to a safer, cleaner, helthier environment. if we all start now to eliminate cars, theworld would bbe a much bbetter pllace.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2004,  0.0053,  0.4315,  ..., -0.3635,  0.9410,  0.2639],

"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement for a few reasons. First, many advertisements use Photoshop or other editing techniques to make the products look better than they actually are. Second, advertisers often use celebrities or other attractive people to make the products look more appealing. Finally, advertisers use persuasive language and emotional appeals to make products seem more appealing than they actually are.

One reason that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that they often use Photoshop or other editing techniques to make the products look better than they actually are. For example, a clothing company might use Photoshop to make their clothes look more flattering on the models than they actually are. Or, a cosmetics company might use Photoshop to make their products look more effective than they actually are. This is misleading to consumers because they are not seeing the true product.

Another reason that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that they often use celebrities or other attractive people to make the products look more appealing. For example, a clothing company might use a famous actress to advertise their clothes. The actress might look amazing in the clothes, but the average person might not look as good. This is misleading to consumers because they think that they will look as good as the celebrity if they buy the product, when in reality they probably won’t.

Finally, advertisers use persuasive language and emotional appeals to make products seem more appealing than they actually are. For example, an advertiser might use persuasive language to make a product seem like it is a “must-have”. Or, an advertiser might use an emotional appeal to make a product seem more appealing, such as by showing a person using the product and looking happy. This is misleading to consumers because they are not seeing the true product.

In conclusion, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is because they often use Photoshop or other editing techniques to make the products look better than they actually are. They also often use celebrities or other attractive people to make the products look more appealing. Finally, they use persuasive language and emotional appeals to make products seem more appealing than they actually are.

"In the past few decades, the number of cars in use has grown exponentially. However, with the rise of new technologies, such as electric vehicles and ride-sharing services, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

The first reason why I believe this is because electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. Electric vehicles are more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars, and they produce fewer emissions. This means that they are better for the environment, and they are also cheaper to operate. As electric vehicles become more affordable and more widely available, more people will be likely to switch to them. This will lead to a decrease in the number of cars in use.

The second reason why I believe there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is because of the rise of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, allow people to get around without having to own a car. This means that people can save money on car ownership costs, such as insurance and maintenance. As ride-sharing services become more popular, more people will be likely to use them instead of owning a car. This will lead to a decrease in the number of cars in use.

The third reason why I believe there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is because of the development of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are cars that can drive themselves, without the need for a human driver. This technology is still in it's early stages, but it is expected to become more widespread in the coming years. Autonomous vehicles will be able to drive more efficiently than human drivers, and they will also be able to reduce traffic congestion. This will lead to a decrease in the number of cars in use.

In conclusion, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is due to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, the rise of ride-sharing services, and the development of autonomous vehicles. All of these factors will lead to a decrease in the number of cars in use, and this will have a positive impact on the environment and on people’s wallets.

"Dear Fellow Citzens,

We all know that cars are a big part of our lives. They get us places fast and make our lifes alot easier. But have you ever thought about how cars are effecting the earth? There are alot of bad things that come from cars. They polute the air and make it harder to breathe. They use alot of gas which comes from fossil fuels which are running out. And they kill alot of people. Like, thousands of people die in car accidents every year. It's crazy.

We should limit car usage for a bunch of reasons. First off, it'll help the earth. If we all drove less, there would be less polution in the air. Plus, we wouldnt use as much gas and that means we wouldnt be using up all the fossil fuels so fast. And it would be safer. There would be fewer cars on the road, so there would be fewer accidents. It's a win-win.

Also, it would be good for our health. Walking and biking are great ways to exersise. If we did those things more, we would be alot healthier. And it would be good for the econimy too. If we all walked and biked more, we wouldnt have to pay so much for gas and car maintance. Think about it.

There are allready alot of ways we can limit car usage. We can carpool, use public transportation, and bike or walk when it's possible. Some cities even have bike lanes and stuff. We just need to start doing it more.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great way to help the earth and our health. It's good for the econimy too. We should all try to drive less and use other ways to get places.

Sincerely,

Your Fellow Citizen",1,"tensor([[-0.0162,  0.0389, -0.3209,  ..., -0.4311,  1.2791,  0.2456],

Taking turns, each of us follows the instructions to complete the experiment. Once finished, we clean up the work space and materials. 

Now that the experiment is complete, we discuss it as a group, reflecting on the process and outcomes.

"Thomas Jefferson said. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Forthermar, not all the people agree with this stament. Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related.

However noeveryone agree. To begin, some of people think they can't make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle.""

Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. But you can get all this if you work hard and. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things

Finally, be related everyday this is something special. Because you always are looking for something more than one. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen.

In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live.  ",0,"tensor([[-0.0623, -0.2198,  0.3007,  ..., -0.7012,  0.7523, -0.6100],

"There are many advantages to driving a car but there are even more reasons to limiting usage on cars as there are to driving one.

Most people today drive thier cars to get from one location to another, but most do not think about what it actually does to the environment. Most cars run on a form of Diesel fuel which release carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses which are harmful towards the environment. Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for around 12% of the greenhouse gasses there. And in most car intensive areas in the United States up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions is released. For a day in France car usage was banned to reduce the amount of smog in the area. After 5 days of intensifying smog the amount of car traffic was reduced by 60%. another great reason for reducing the usage of cars is that it causes less stress towards people and yourself. And it greatly reduces traffic for other cars. in Bogota, once a year they have a day without cars which is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Since then it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, sports centers, and multiple parks. Some people prefer biking than driving which i salso a good way to get fit. Since there are so many bikers there most of the uneven sidewalks have been replaced by larger and smoother sidewalks.

In the end, there are many reasons to limit the usage of cars but people should consider it more for what it does for the world.",0,"tensor([[-0.1857, -0.3427, -0.0247,  ..., -0.3897,  0.6851,  0.0260],

"""I believe that drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is because it is a major distraction and can lead to accidents, which can cause harm to both the driver and other people on the road.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving can be very distracting. It takes the driver's attention away from the road, and they may not be able to react quickly enough to avoid an accident. For example, if a driver is texting while driving, they may not see a pedestrian crossing the road or a car stopping in front of them. This can lead to a serious accident, which can cause injury or even death.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving can also be dangerous because it can cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle. If a driver is talking on the phone, they may not be able to react quickly enough to avoid a sudden obstacle in the road. This can cause the driver to swerve or lose control of the vehicle, which can lead to a serious accident.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is a major distraction and can lead to accidents, which can cause harm to both the driver and other people on the road.

"Plan My claim would have to be that computers who identify human emotions would be a valubale thinkg because many students come to class felling down or sad sometimes and instead of them keeping i to them selves.

Somebody would hopefully be kind enough and ask if there doing okay or if they need somebody to talk to instead of just having to go thruogh it them selves, just like a child going thru depresion at the end of the day you want to look for those children and help them. But another think would be why would we need this in class instead of using money for this technology they should fix the schools and bring more learning experiences around the country instead of wasting money to see how somebody is feeling youll make somebody happy by just saying have a wonderful day today like the person grading this test i hope you have a wonderful day and i hope at the end of the day i pass this because its a big part of high school and im clearly not the smartest student but at the end of the day i get what i have to do done and dont complain but this invension would be a good project to go around at the airport or banks just to see peoples reaction when they walk in and as there going out to see the diffrence of there face reactions. the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile while it shows how much this computer can do,imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad, thatll be really creapy once it knows how you're feeling.

LIke example ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. but if you frown the next ad will be different."" this sounds good so when you want certain kind of apps to pop up but once the system knows how youre feeling is another thing instead of seeing how im feeling they should help out people in need who need the help to help them keep there emotions better, Also crazy how theis technology would make it easy for a computer to recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. My claim would have to be that I would wan this in my class or around my school beacuse i personaly feel like many students will come into school with a diffrent mood if they knew there expresions or feelings are all being detected, instead of them coming sad theyll probabaly chear up a bit since they maybe dont want anybody to know how there feeling and itll try to hid it and change there mood from what it was at first. This process all beigins with a computer that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model unit must move like a human muscles. Some coding system facial expressions that its going to be able to read is six basic emotions like happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear ,and sadness, many people are not gonna like the idea of this beause people don want to let everbody know what they are feeling or what there thinking of.",0,"tensor([[-0.0863, -0.2266,  0.5144,  ..., -0.3509,  0.8639,  0.1885],

what you have already mastered ,those people they don't bealive they don't grow up ,that is not true we have to create a new things improve us self we don't like to stay the same place and nothing is imposible.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0347, -0.2296,  0.3897,  ..., -0.9966,  0.6670, -0.0763],

"The world of professional wrestling is often maligned and misunderstood by those who do not understand the industry. To many, it may seem like nothing more than a performance art or entertainment show rooted in outlandish storylines and over-the-top physical stunts. However, in reality, professional wrestling has been around for centuries as an athletic pursuit with its own set of complex rules and regulations. Professional wrestlers must possess a unique combination of strength, agility, flexibility and knowledge to excel at their craft. Much like any other competitive sport, the most successful athletes are able to use strategy to outwit their opponents whilst also displaying incredible feats of athleticism between the ropes. The level of skill required means that contestants can be held accountable for every move they make inside the ring as well as any words they utter outside it – making this form of competition one that focuses on both physical and mental ability equally. Though professional wrestling often appears chaotic on camera due to flashy entrances and wild matches, each performer is highly trained in both offense and defense techniques so that all moves flow logically together while engaging fans along the way. This makes sure that no wrestler puts themselves or their opponent in harm’s way unnecessarily during a match – something which would invariably lead to serious injury if not monitored properly by referees or trainers backstage overseeing proceedings throughout each bout. Professional wrestling has come al long way since its humble beginnings but still remains fiercely contested within its own circles today; providing thrilling entertainment for viewers from all over the world who tune in weekly to watch some amazing competitors battle it out inside (and sometimes even outside) the squared circle!

"Do you ever just want to do something but have no clue how to do it? Well you may look it up or you may ask other people for advice. When you ask another person for advice it is probably better than looking it up because they have the experience of it, and what happened. But, when you get advice, do you get it from just one person, or multiple? Even though it takes up more time it is better to get advice from multiple people. I believe it is better to get advice from a few different people is because one person may have done it wrong, you can compare the different options, and you can see if there way of doing things is more valid.

It is better to get multiple opinions because the one person you ask may have done it wrong. If they did it wrong and things didn't turn out well, the may try to give you advice on it but probably won't give you the exact way of doing it correctly. If you got one opinion and put it on front of you you would think it is correct because it is all you have. But then, you get three opinions and put them in front of you, and two of them are the same and one is different, it would be obvious with way is better. So, having a few choices will give you a better chance doing it correct. Afterwards, you would probably be happy that you got multiple opinions.

The second reason that it is good to get a few opinions is because you can compare the different options. Like I said you are more incline to pick one way if there was more people doing it that way. Rather than just asking one person and having no other knowledge, asking three or more people will give you a better option at it and also what not to do. Also, while comparing them and thinking of what they did right and wrong, you may realize that you may have a better way to do it. Another reason to compare is that everyone you asked may be wrong and if you compare, and ask more people, you will eventually find the correct way of doing it.

The last reason I have for this is that the more people you ask, the more valid. If you ask one person it is a fifty-fifty chance of being right or wrong. So if you ask ten people it will be more clear what the right way of doing it is. Think of a science experiment, the more times you do it, the more valid your turn out is. Just like that the more people the more valid. One you determine the one that has the most validity will probably be your way of doing it.

After the process of going through all of your options, you will most likely find the most valid way of doing whatever you are trying to do. It depends on the amount of people that you ask and how you compare different ways, maybe even making up your own way to do it. The amount of different ways to do something is almost endless. That is why I think that you should get more opinions, to see if any are wrong so you will not repeat them, compare them, and choose the most valid.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1675, -0.4861, -0.1277,  ..., -0.0695,  0.3961,  0.6690],

"To begin with, I am going to be listing my reasons on why i agree to the statement that the former British prime minister winston churchill said. In each paragraph I will be supporting my reasons.

To start off with, My first reason on why i agree with the statement Is because their Is always a saying that says keep trying don't give up. When i read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want.

Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture' I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time.

Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish.

"""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not foor prsident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president,"" says Bradford Plumer in Source 2.  If the citizens of the United States aren't voting for President then why do they vote?  The Electoral College system should be change to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  Other people, for instince Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the electoral college.  Having an election without the electoral college, where popular vote is used would make voting fair and the people's voice heard.

A popular vote system would be more fair then having other people, who use favoritism, choose a president for you.  Plumer also said "". . . according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""  That's just one example of the popular vote losing presidency because of the electoral college.  They should change the system so the is a tie in votes from the U.S. citizens, then the Electoral College should come into use.  It would make the system fair and a majority of citizens would not be upset.  Having no electoral college would also make more people vote too.  Some people do vote  because they feel like there is no reason to when they have no say in who gets elected.  If they heard that the elections for now on were based on popularity, they might even be the first in line.

Since the electoral college is deciding who is president, they might select an awful president that will make the U.S. the worse country in the world.  The popular vote would have been for the other guy.  The govenment would finally learn the hard way when the country is in ruins and would change election for the future to a popular vote election. Soon citizens are just going to stop voting because they are highly upset that the popular vote keeps losing because of the Electoral College.  People are going to start hating the government for not changing the voting system.  In the future there could be lots of riots and protests against the government.  Then the United States would be a terrifying place to live because of the citizen killing and police killings.

"In the artilce ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the writer presents the idea that though exploration of venus is dangerous it will be worthwhile in the long run. In the intro of the article the writer opens up by saying Venus is sometimes called the ""evening star"". The writer explains that the nickname given to venus came about because Venus is very easily spotted from Earth even though venus is a planet and not a star. The writer then goes on to say "" While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"".

Paragraph two and three expains venus is similar to earth but also how Venus is dangerous. Paragraph two opens up how Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of Venus is closest to earth in terms of density and size. The writer then explains how Earth, Venus, and Mars are planetary neighbors and how all three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and how sometimes how Mars will sometimes be closer to Earth and how sometimes Venus is closer to Earth. The writer then goes on to talk about how humans have sent multiple unmanned spacecrafts to venus but none have reached the surface of the planet due to the various factors that make Venus a ""challenging planet for humans to study"". Paragraph 3 explains the dangerous aspects of Venus. The writer opens up with how a ""thick atmosphere of almost nintey seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". The writer then goes on to talk about how average tempatures on Venus are over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and how the atmosperic pressure is nintey times greater than Earth and that these conditions are far more extreme than Earth's conditions.

Opening up paragraph four the writer asks "" if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists evn discussing further visits to its surface?"". The writer explains that astronomers are interested by Venus because it may have once been ""the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" saying that Venus may have been once covered largely with oceans and could have supported many different forms of life. The writer then says that even now Venus still has vast surfaces of rockey sediment and includes familiar features similar to earth. The writer then makes a statement saying that "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisutable"". Paragraph 5 opens up with how nasa been discussing sending humans to Venus. The writer then goes on to talk about how in order for this idea to work nasa would have to make a special spacecraft that would have to be thirty miles above the surface of Venus. The writer then goes into specifics of how maintaining life on the spacecraft would work.

Paragraph six continues with how the spacecraft would operate. The writer then talks about how scientists would not be able to collect samples from the surface of Venus and how scientists are working on ""innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". Paragraph seven mainly talks about nasa and their other approches to studying Venus. The writer eplains that nasa did a experiment where electrons made of silicon carbide were tested in a chamber simulating the ""chaos of Venus's surface"". The particles only lasted three weeks. It is then explained how nasa was looking to use old technology called 'mechanical computers"". The writer eplains that these computers used gears and levers and no electronics at all. The writer then goes on to talk about how this computer would do better resistance wise in Venus's environment.

Finally in paragraph eight the writer talks about how

""striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value"" meaning that though it will be difficult to explore Venus it will be worth it because humanity will have more research on our sister planet along with that ""our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This means that we should not let dangerous situations limit human exporation and evolution.",0,"tensor([[-0.7359,  0.0689, -0.4476,  ...,  0.1875,  0.9380,  0.1491],

"Driving and Phones

Phones and driving have been a big problem and continue to be a big problem. Just one careless person looking down to read a text could result in multiple deaths. People don't fully grasp the reality of the danger that is really there, people think that oh it would never happen to them or that they're too good a driver for them to hit someone. But just looking down at your phone could end things for you and others.

Could be someone walking, another car, a child, an animal, anything. When you take your yes off the road then it distracts you from your surroundings, from where you're going, from whats infront of you.

There are already laws in place to try and stop people from being on their phones while behind the wheel, but some people just don't care and some people think that they could just never hit someone or something. Cell phones should not be a priority while driving, you are trying to get from point A to point B. You should be able to wait till you are out of the car to answer a text or check social media. If it is urgent then simply pull over as soon as you can and get to it. But you should never be on your phone behind the wheel.

There has been many deaths related to cell phones and driving and with people becoming more and more addicted and attached to their phones and social media its harder and harder to get people off their phones. People are so attached that they are on their phones all the time not caring where they are.

I believe we should have harsher punishments and better ways to detect people on their phone. Maybe a harsher punishment for just being seen holding it behind the wheel will make some people think twice.",0,"tensor([[ 1.6183e-01, -1.8516e-01,  2.3367e-01,  ..., -1.5177e-01,

"  Revolutionizing Urban Living  In an age defined by the ever-growing challenges of urbanization and environmental degradation, the concept of car-free cities is emerging as a transformative approach to reimagining urban life. Car-free cities prioritize the use of sustainable transportation options and restrict or eliminate private automobiles in urban spaces, fostering cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant environments. This essay delves into the concept of car-free cities, exploring their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities embody a vision of urban living that champions sustainability, health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a vital role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This responsible approach is integral to combating climate change.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to enhanced respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Use of Space: These cities efficiently repurpose urban space by converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape and enhances the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a significant financial burden. In car-free cities, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, which contributes to their overall financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The shift to car-free living can face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities relies on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a vital aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands thorough planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and prioritizing public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a compelling vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent an inspiring glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1,"tensor([[-0.3799, -0.6381, -0.1148,  ..., -0.5154, -0.2897, -0.0913],

Praise is an important tool that we can use to express gratitude and admiration for someone’s work or accomplishments. Praise can be used to acknowledge someone’s efforts and show appreciation for a job well done. Furthermore, it can be a powerful tool in boosting someone’s self-esteem. When children receive praise for their accomplishments in school, they can gain confidence and become motivated to push themselves further and continue to strive for excellence. Similarly, someone’s hard work and dedication at their job can encourage positive reinforcement through praise, leading to improved morale and productivity. Finally, praise can be used to show support and appreciation in our everyday lives; talking positively about someone or recognizing their strengths let them know that they are valued and appreciated.

By using praise in a positive and helpful way, we can create a kinder and more compassionate community and society. Overcoming negative mindsets is a critical goal for us to achieve. Praise helps people to build more resilience, increased self-confidence, and a sense of purpose. Praise lets people know that they are seen, heard and appreciated, offering a sense of hope in dark times. It helps to create connections and foster a sense of empathy and understanding between people. Through praise, we can make the world a better place.

"There is no one answer to this question as it depends on each individual's perspective. Some people may believe that education is a life-long process that should be pursued continuously, while others may believe that it is something that is completed once a person receives their degree or diploma.

I believe that education is a life-long process, and that it is something that should be pursued continuously. There are many reasons why I hold this belief. First, education provides individuals with the opportunity to learn new things and to expand their knowledge. This can be extremely beneficial, as it allows people to keep up with the latest trends and developments in their field, and to stay ahead of their competition. Additionally, education can help to improve an individual's skills and abilities. For example, through continuing education, a person may be able to learn new software programs or to improve their writing skills.

Another reason why I believe that education should be a life-long pursuit is because it can help to keep people mentally active and healthy. Studies have shown that people who are engaged in learning activities tend to have better mental health than those who are not. Education can also help to keep people socially active, as they may meet new people and make new friends through their courses or programs.

While I believe that education is a life-long process that should be pursued continuously, I recognize that not everyone may agree. Some people may feel that they have completed their education once they receive their degree or diploma. Others may feel that they do not have the time or the money to continue their education. However, I believe that everyone should at least consider continuing their education, as it can be beneficial in many ways.

"In recent times, a debate has emerged on whether it is appropriate to tell the patient the truth about their cancer diagnosis in the Chinese culture. While telling the truth is a norm in the western world, it is not the case in China, where it is customary to avoid sharing the diagnosis with the patient. As the country continues to modernize, some people believe that this traditional practice must change. I wholeheartedly agree with this stance, and in this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.

Firstly, honesty is a fundamental value that should always be upheld, irrespective of culture or geographical location. The patient has the right to know about their medical condition, as it concerns their life and wellbeing. In a sense, it is unethical to withhold the truth from a patient who may want to make informed decisions about their treatment and care. It is essential to provide the patient with accurate information that can help them understand the nature of the disease, it's prognosis, and treatment options.

Secondly, not telling the patient the truth can have long-term negative effects on the family's mental health. Keeping the diagnosis a secret can cause a tremendous amount of stress, anxiety, and guilt for family members who feel responsible for making decisions on behalf of the patient. Moreover, not disclosing the diagnosis can lead to feelings of resentment and mistrust from the patient if they ever find out. It can also create a sense of isolation and loneliness for the patient, as they are not allowed to share their thoughts or emotions with their loved ones.

Finally, the Chinese culture has evolved over time, and some traditional practices have become outdated. With the increasing influence of western values and practices, there is a growing awareness of the importance of transparency and honesty in medical care. Chinese medical professionals are now recognizing the need to inform patients about their diagnosis accurately. This change is evident in the increasing number of cancer patients who are now being informed about their condition in Chinese hospitals.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the traditional practice of not telling the patient the truth about their cancer diagnosis must change. It is essential to uphold the value of honesty and integrity in medical care, and the patient has the right to know about their medical condition. Not sharing the diagnosis can have adverse effects on the family's mental health and create feelings of mistrust and isolation for the patient. As the Chinese culture continues to evolve and modernize, it is imperative to embrace new values and practices that prioritize the patient's wellbeing.

"Education is undoubtedly a vital part of life and an integral component in today’s globalized world. It is the single most important factor that determines an individual’s success and future prospects. In a globalized economy, the cost of education has become increasingly expensive. However, I believe that the consequences of a failure to educate are even more expensive in the long run.

In today’s highly competitive job market, employers are increasingly looking for job applicants with specialized skills and knowledge. Without a formal education, it is extremely difficult to obtain these skills and knowledge. Education provides an opportunity to develop the necessary skills to succeed in today’s modern world. It allows individuals to gain insight into the workings of the world and to develop their own unique perspectives. Furthermore, having a formal education makes an individual more valuable to employers, since they are more likely to possess the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the workplace.

Moreover, education allows for economic growth. Highly educated individuals often become entrepreneurs, creating new businesses and jobs, which leads to an increase in economic activity. This economic activity often creates a positive feedback loop, as the increased economic activity attracts more businesses, leading to more jobs and further economic growth. Furthermore, the highly educated are often more successful in terms of their wages and salaries, resulting in increased government revenue through taxation.

Finally, education also has many social benefits. Higher levels of education often lead to increased levels of tolerance and understanding, since educated individuals are more likely to be exposed to diverse perspectives. Furthermore, education provides the opportunity to become a part of a larger community, often providing access to different networks and resources that can be beneficial in many ways.

In conclusion, education is undoubtedly expensive. However, the consequences of a failure to educate are even more expensive in the long run. Education provides an opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world. Moreover, it allows for economic growth and provides many social benefits. Therefore, investing in education is an investment in the future.

"I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about. I agree with him because if you do the same thing you Mastered you will never grow but if you do more things and then you mastered you will grow a lot. You need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything so you can grow. I'll give you a example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that.

You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. It's good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. It's always good to do more what you Mastered in life.

Online classes provide many distinct advantages over traditional schooling, particularly for those with unique family circumstances, safety concerns, or medical conditions. For parents who travel frequently, for example, online classes give their children the opportunity to continue their education while on the road. In addition, online classes allow students to manage schoolwork in a safe and secure environment, away from potential threats that can occur in traditional classroom settings. Finally, for students with medical conditions, such as chronic pain due to autoimmune diseases, online classes provide a more comfortable way to learn, as they can be adjusted as needed for increased comfort and accessibility. 

In conclusion, online classes offer a unique opportunity for students to learn at their own pace, from the safety of their own homes, and with the added convenience of making accommodations for medical or family needs as they happen.",1,"tensor([[ 0.0191, -0.2588, -0.1970,  ..., -0.1945, -0.1591,  0.5488],

"Politics and morality are often viewed as separate realms, with politics being characterized by power, economic interests, and strategic calculations, while morality is seen as a domain of individual ethics, values, and principles. However, this dichotomy is misleading and misrepresents the complex interdependencies between politics and morality. In fact, politics and morality are intimately connected and cannot be properly understood without acknowledging their interdependence. In this essay, I argue that those who treat politics and morality as separate realms fail to understand either the one or the other.

To begin with, politics is not a value-neutral enterprise but a sphere of ethical decision-making. Political actors and institutions are constantly making choices that have moral implications for individuals and society as a whole. For instance, when a government decides to cut social welfare programs to reduce the budget deficit, it is making a moral judgment about the trade-off between fiscal responsibility and social justice. Similarly, when a country decides to go to war, it is making a moral judgment about the legitimacy of using force to achieve political objectives. In both cases, politics and morality are inextricably linked, and it is impossible to make a clear distinction between the two.

Moreover, morality is not just an individual concern but a shared and contested domain that has political implications. Morality is shaped by cultural, historical, and ideological factors that inform the norms, values, and beliefs of a society. Therefore, when political actors appeal to moral arguments, they are not simply expressing their personal opinions but mobilizing a broader moral discourse that resonates with their constituencies. For instance, when a politician argues for the legalization of same-sex marriage, she is not only making a legal or political argument but also invoking a moral argument about tolerance, equality, and human dignity. In this sense, politics and morality are mutually reinforcing and cannot be meaningfully separated.

Furthermore, politics and morality are intertwined in the way they shape and reflect social power relations. Politics is not only about formal institutions and procedures but also about the distribution of power and resources in a society. Therefore, political decisions have winners and losers, and they often reflect and perpetuate existing inequalities and injustices. Morality, on the other hand, is not only about individual virtues and values but also about collective norms and practices that regulate social interactions. Therefore, moral values can either reinforce or challenge power relations, depending on how they are interpreted and applied. For instance, the moral principle of respect for human rights can be a powerful tool for challenging authoritarian regimes and promoting social justice, but it can also be co-opted by powerful actors to legitimize their interests and agendas. In this sense, politics and morality are intertwined in complex and dynamic ways that require careful analysis and reflection.

In conclusion, those who treat politics and morality as separate realms fail to understand the complexity and interdependence of these two domains. Politics is not a value-neutral enterprise but a sphere of ethical decision-making that has moral implications for individuals and society. Morality is not just an individual concern but a shared and contested domain that has political implications. Politics and morality are intertwined in the way they shape and reflect social power relations. Therefore, any meaningful analysis of politics and morality requires an integrated and multidisciplinary approach that acknowledges their interdependence and complexity.

Community service can bring about substantial positive changes to our school community and beyond. Allowing students to complete mandatory service hours could help form an active, compassionate and responsible student body that goes out into the world prepared to create positive change. 

We should start teaching students to give back to their community right away. When everybody pitches in a little, the benefits are felt by many. For instance, community service encourages youth to become better informed citizens, as they start to think more about the wider implications of their actions for their community, and the world beyond. Through community service, our students would learn to prioritize collaboration and collective problem-solving, as well as acquire habits that promote positive social values. 

Along with developing an understanding of societal issues, volunteerism helps to build self-confidence and practical skills. Our students would be developing self-esteem as they gain skills that would be beneficial for their future. It is important to impart a sense of purpose and meaning to our students, and offering opportunities to help others through service would be an excellent way to do that.

By having students take part in community service, our school could contribute to the bettering of our society. We can make sure that students gain first-hand experience that will help to build responsible citizens who are ready to make positive changes in our community. Therefore, I urge the principle to accept the idea of all students performing community service.",1,"tensor([[ 0.0111, -0.2218, -0.4980,  ..., -0.4608,  0.6014,  0.2693],

"I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online.

Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.

I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.

Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers. Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future.        ",0,"tensor([[ 4.4123e-02, -2.6180e-01, -9.6258e-04,  ..., -6.2527e-01,

"It is often said that youth is wasted on the young. This may be true in some respects, but it is also true that older people often fail to appreciate the many joys that life has to offer. There are many reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older people do.

For one thing, younger people are generally more physically active than older people. They are more likely to go out and explore the world, and to take part in physical activities such as sports. This means that they are more likely to experience the joy of physical exertion and the sense of achievement that comes with it.

In addition, younger people are generally more open to new experiences than older people. They are more likely to try new things, and to be open to new ideas. This means that they are more likely to have a richer and more varied life experience.

Finally, younger people are generally more optimistic than older people. They tend to believe that anything is possible, and that the future will be better than the present. This means that they are more likely to enjoy life, even when things are tough.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why younger people enjoy life more than older people do. This is not to say that older people cannot enjoy life, but that younger people are more likely to do so.

"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states very clearly how beneficial studying Venus would be, despite all the dangers. Even after learning how harsh the conditions are on ground level, for some reason, the author still believes the danger would be worth it. Though my own opinion may vary from the author's, they still give very convincing reasons for their point of view. According to the article, the main two reasons Venus would be beneficial for humans to study would be the amount of information that could be learned about the landscape of Venus millions of years ago, and to satisfy human curiosity while having the satisfaction completing a challenge we have been faced with for centuries.

Though the author gives several convinving reasons for studying Venus, perhaps the most influential would be the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus. In paragraph four, the author discusses that Venus displays several features similar to Earth, meaning it is possible Venus used be a whole lot like Earth. As stated directly in paragraph four, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" Solely based off the information provided in this quote, the author has already begun to convince me learning more about Venus might actually lead to some pretty extraordinary discoveries. What this quote is saying is millions of years ago Venus may have been the planet with the most liveable conditions...instead of Earth. If scientists were able to discover this much, just imagine all the other life forms and food webs that could be uncovered. To reinforce their opinion on Venus potentislly being liveable in the past, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" at the end of paragraph four. What the author is saying in this quote is at this point, all we have to do is find out how to brave the conditions of Venus. As for travel time, Venus is practically our neighbor, so no worries there.

A secondary reason the author provides as to why humans should study Venus is to satisfy human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task that has troubled humans for centuries. The author states this idea in paragraph eight when saying, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In this quote, the author is saying due to the fact that humans are extremely curious, we will likely find ourselves in a predicament with similar tough challenges in the future, so we may as well begin working through some of them now. When one sets out to complete a task, they should not stop halfway, but follow through until the problem is solved. They also should not quit because they believe the challenge is too hard. If one is able to stick with their guts and do what needs to be done, they will reap the benefits. Whether those benefits be winning a tough volleyball match or finally sending a human to Venus, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we do not stop believing in ourselves and our ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible.

In conclusion, the author has given many, specifically two, very convincing reasons as to why we should continue to study Venus. The main two reasons are the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus, and satisfying human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task which has troubled humans for centuries. Based on the authors suggestions on why humans should continue to study Venus, I have considered changing my mind and agreeing that the dangers would be worth it. It is important to have knowledge about the past of our solar system, and it would be very interesting to know if Venus was once able to support various forms of life. I also feel that the author made a good point in stating that we are already this far into studies, so we should not give up now. Humans are always going to be insatiably curious, so by not finding a solution to this problem now, we are just placing this challege upon the generation following us. After all, curiosity technically never killed the cat.",0,"tensor([[-0.4561,  0.1355, -0.7673,  ..., -0.0491,  0.7661, -0.0887],

"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and promote healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. This trend is already being seen in various parts of the world, including German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number increases to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that separate themselves from car use, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a decline in congestion. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time people spend in their cars, improving productivity and quality of life. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced during periods of severe pollution, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have a direct impact on reducing traffic and improving air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This shift has led to people adopting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and using public transportation. These activities not only contribute to increased physical activity but also reduce air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels.

Additionally, limiting car usage encourages the development of more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This concept is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, making suburbs more pedestrian-friendly and reducing the need for large parking spaces. By creating more walkable communities, we can promote social interaction, support local businesses, and reduce the need for excessive car usage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can positively impact individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, alleviates traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and fosters the development of sustainable communities. As seen in various examples around the world, including Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, the shift towards limiting car usage is gaining traction and proving to be beneficial for both present and future generations. It is important for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that promote alternative modes of transportation.",1,"tensor([[-0.4901, -0.2737, -0.2393,  ..., -0.1963,  0.2594, -0.2747],

"Self-improvement is a popular concept that is often seen as a desirable goal for anyone to strive for. But the idea that self-improvement should be a primary goal in life is a problematic one, as it implies that people are inherently lacking and need to be improved. I disagree with this notion, as it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and the belief that one has to be perfect to be worthy of love and acceptance.

First of all, the idea that people must strive for self-improvement implies that they are currently deficient or inadequate in some way. It'suggests that they must somehow “fix” themselves in order to be better or reach a certain level of perfection. However, this assumption is flawed, as it overlooks the fact that everyone is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has something special to offer and no one should be made to feel like they are lacking or inadequate.

Moreover, this idea can lead to feelings of self-doubt and insecurity, as it implies that one must meet a certain standard in order to be worthy of love and acceptance. This can be damaging to one’s mental health, as it can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, this thought pattern can become a vicious cycle, as the more one focuses on self-improvement, the more they may feel like they are never good enough.

Rather than believing that self-improvement should be a primary goal in life, we should focus on self-acceptance. This means recognizing and appreciating who we are, flaws and all. We should learn to love ourselves for who we are and be kind to ourselves, rather than trying to change ourselves to fit an ideal. This can help to boost our self-esteem, which in turn can lead to more positive thoughts and behaviors.

It is also important to remember that self-improvement is not a linear process. While striving to reach our goals and become the best versions of ourselves is admirable, it is equally important to remember that we all make mistakes and that failure is a part of life. We should focus on learning from our mistakes and growing from them, rather than berating ourselves for not reaching our goals.

In conclusion, while striving for self-improvement is a noble endeavor, the idea that it'should be a primary goal in life is a problematic one. It implies that people are inherently inadequate and must strive to be perfect in order to be worthy of love and acceptance. Instead, we should focus on self-acceptance and be kind to ourselves, as this can help to boost our self-esteem and lead to more positive thoughts and behaviors.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While it is understood that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be taken into consideration.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As the system currently stands, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the potential for disputed elections is significantly reduced. In contrast, a direct popular vote system would likely result in more disputes over the outcome, as any slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact. This stability and certainty are crucial in ensuring that our democratic process is respected and can move forward efficiently.

Furthermore, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters. This is important because it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. It fosters national unity and prevents the marginalization of certain areas or interests. Under a popular vote system, candidates would have less incentive to campaign in regions that they know they cannot win, which could lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among voters in those areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states or toss-up states. These states are typically more representative of the entire nation and are likely to have a more thoughtful and engaged electorate. By prioritizing these states, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of a wider range of voters. This ensures that the election is decided by the most informed and engaged citizens, leading to a more representative outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. Large states have more electoral votes and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This is important in offsetting the disproportionate power held by small states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By giving larger states more weight in the election process, the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard and their interests are taken into account.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complications and logistical challenges that come with run-off elections. It also prevents situations where a candidate with a small plurality of the popular vote could win the election, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the presidency.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of voters in presidential elections are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. The impact of a single vote in a national election is limited, yet millions of Americans still cast their votes because they believe in the democratic process and want their voice to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides stability, regional representation, thoughtful decision-making, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner. It may have its flaws, but it is a system that has proven effective in ensuring the fair and representative selection of the President. I urge you to consider these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Sustainable living is an increasingly popular lifestyle choice among homeowners and renters alike. It involves making conscious attempts to reduce one's environmental impact, from the materials used to build a home to the food that is consumed and waste that is produced. While there are many different approaches to sustainable living, this essay will focus on three particular aspects: green building techniques for housing construction; energy conservation through efficient appliances and renewable sources of power; and reducing landfill waste through recycling and composting. Green Building Techniques for Sustainable Living In order to live more sustainably, it is important to use building methods that minimize the negative impacts on our environment. This means selecting material such as wood or stone instead of metal or plastic when constructing a house or other type of structure. Additionally, utilizing local resources whenever possible can help reduce reliance on imported items which often have higher carbon footprints due to transportation costs associated with them. Another way green building practices can be utilized in sustainable living is by incorporating natural elements into one's home design such as solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal wells, rainwater catchment systems, or green roofs which allow plants rather than shingles/tiles coverings atop houses. These features not only create aesthetically pleasing dwellings but also help conserve energy by providing alternative sources of electricity generation while cutting down on harmful emissions from traditional fossil fuels like coal or oil products normally used in homes today. Energy Conservation Through Efficient Appliances. Another key component in creating a sustainable lifestyle is using energy-efficient appliances at home and replacing any old models with newer ones less likely contribute heavily towards global warming emissions caused by burning fossil fuels during manufacturing processes such as refrigerators running constantly throughout day/night cycles without stop (even if turned off). Energy Star rated appliances are some good examples here since they're designed specifically for their efficiency levels ensuring households see tangible reductions utility bills over time plus helping protect environment too! Other ways people can cut down household’s energy consumption include switching

"Senator [Name],

I write to you as a student studying the intriguing and complex fabric of American democracy. A considerable debate that I am currently studying is centered around the enduring institution of the Electoral College, a distinctive mechanism our Founding Fathers established for the presidential elections. Within the scope of this discussion, I would like to advocate for the continued use of the Electoral College System, while acknowledging some of the criticisms and limitations inherent in this system.

One of the primary arguments against the Electoral College is that it appears undemocratic, as the president is ultimately elected by electors rather than the popular vote (Posner 15). Critics also emphasize the possibility of elector manipulation and the risk of a presidential election being influenced by ""faithless"" electors (Plumer 11). Notably, criticism has also been focused on the system's unfair concentration on swing states (Plumer 13). While these critiques are well-founded, I would like to offer a multifaceted defense of the Electoral College.

Initially, the certainty of outcome that's inherent in the system is a significant advantage (Posner 18). As with any system, disputes can arise, but they're often less ambiguous due to the Electoral College's structure which often awards a larger proportion of total electoral votes to the victor (Posner 18). Furthermore, the system helps ensure that a president must demonstrate broad appeal, rather than focusing solely on densely populated urban areas or regions where they are most popular (Posner 19). Every state matters under this system, not just the populous ones.

Another key argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages voters in swing states to engage closely with the election process (Posner 20). These voters are central to determining the outcome of the election, which fosters greater political engagement and thoughtful deliberation on the issues at hand. Moreover, the Electoral College offers a counterbalance to potential inequalities presented by Senate apportionment, offering large states more influence in the presidential election (Posner 21).

In my view, an often overlooked advantage of the Electoral College is that it inherently precludes the need for run-off elections, resulting in a clear decision (Posner 22). This, in turn, reduces the complication in the overall presidential election process, contributing to its efficiency. 

Granted, concern exists that voters in staunchly Republican or Democratic states may not vote because the outcome is a foregone conclusion (Posner 23). I would argue, however, that this challenge can be overcome with increased civic education and voter engagement initiatives, emphasizing the value of expressing a political preference through voting. 

To conclude, I believe the Electoral College, uniquely American in its design, remains a viable method for selecting the president. Even though the notion of direct democracy through a direct popular vote seems attractive and simplistically fair, we must consider the practical implications and consequences. It is crucial to ensure the system continues to strike a balance that represents all Americans' interests irrespective of their location. For all its foibles, the Electoral College assures this representation, fostering a federalist and representative democracy that has persevered since our country's inception.

Respectfully yours,

"Phones and Driving

Should a person text and drive?

Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. I don't think you should always do it or always have to the need to use your phone while thing is happening around you. Imaging going 65 mph and your jus on the phone playing candy crush. What the chances of something wrong happening. A LOT

Driving is dangerous for those who don't really know a lot About it. You have to be sharp on the look about. What if a kid runs out to get his ball and you don't pay attention because you were on the phone? That would be devastating for your and the kid's family, having to act like you really wasn't on the phone lying that you didn't see him. All because they were on to phone and couldn't wait till, they were at a full stop to check it.

I think that's the only time you can check your phone, and I'm not talking about checking your whole social media accounts. I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.

Its never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.

Should a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature.

"The so called ""Face"" on Mars brought an abundance of attention to NASA and the planet Mars. Everything from magazines, books, and a movie talked about how the Face was created by aliens. The Face was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform found on Mars.

The Face was reveald from a photo taken by Viking 1 in 1976. The photo taken looked like a face because the cameras where not as advance has they are today. The photo was taken with a resolution with 43 meters per pixel leaving out many details that could not be captured, therefore making the landform appear as if it were a face. When NASA took a seccond photo with a camera that had a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel in the exact same location as the first photo was taken the image looked nothing like a face because it captured many more details than the first this show the distortion of the first caused it to look like a face. Also when the seccond photo was taken it was a clear day and there was not any clouds unlike the first photo which means it could not have been affected at all. Unlike the seccond image the first had clouds which could draken or lighten the image in certain places to give details that make it look like a face are not actually there on the landform.

In conclusion, the so called ""Face"" on Mars is nothing but a landform on the planet. It was not created by aliens, but the planet it self.

"Dear State Senator,

I'm

NOT

in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I wouldn't like to keep the Electoral Collage because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.We are used to voting for the president and along with that president we would also have the counting of electoral votes, it's wrong. For example, If you lived in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who pick the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state coventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themeselves.

All i know that it isnt fair. All of are hard work voting shouldn't go towards them. It should go towards the person we are voting for. Isn't thats why we voted for them? So we can see them suceed. Making us feel like we suceeded because we made them feel welcome and worthy. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that's the problem. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. And that's why

THIS

needs to stop. At them most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend thime in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

In conclusion, It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argument in faor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Bob Dole is right: Abolish the electoral college!

I hope you take sometime to think this over.

"People in America vote for a candidate running for president believing that their vote counts, but in reality it all comes down to the Electoral College. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tot he kind we have now."" We, as a country, need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states in order to have fair competion instead of the people of America voting for a potential president only to find out the vote was worth nothing.

To begin with, majority of the nation wants to abolish the Electoral Congress because it's an unfair process. Bradford plumer states, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors so they can vote for the president putting our nation's future in danger. The Electoral College used to be the the right way of election but now it's known as something from the past. Traditionally, the Electoral College was ""a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, (paragraph 1, by the Office of the Federal Register)"" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. But now, this process is ""outdated (paragraph 14, Bradford Plumer)"" and there needs to be election by popular vote.

Another key point, former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, agree with ""abolishing the electoral college (paragraph 9,

Bradford Plumer)"" as do Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and the Gallup poll in 2000. Majority wants to get rid of the Electoral College in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. also, voters cant always control who their electors vote for. Bradford Plumer notes, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" The Al Gore election is an example of the unfairness that the Electoral College is pursuing. Al Gore won the popular vote against George W. Bush nationwide, which means the people wanted Gore, but he did not recieve enough electoral votes to win the election.

In the Electoral College's defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Posner, ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. Without the Electoral College, the president wouldn't have ""trans-regional appeal (paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner),"" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president so the Electoral College requires the ""trans-regional appeal.""

To conclude, our nation needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of election by the Electoral College because this process of election is unfair to the voters of this nation. Also, majority wins and the majority of the country wants to repeal the Electoral College then we should make a change. If we want this nation to be the strongest it can be then we need to make choices that will positively affect our country and the people of our country.",0,"tensor([[-0.8809,  0.0633, -0.9620,  ...,  0.1187,  1.0198,  0.5876],

"The Chinese culture traditionally does not tell patients about their cancers in a frank manner. This is often seen as being disrespectful to the patient and may cause them to feel overwhelmed and scared. There are many reasons why this tradition may persist, but one reason may be that the Chinese believe that the patient should be the one to make the decision about whether or not to tell others about their illness. This is often seen as being a personal matter and should not be shared with others without the patient’s consent.

However, with the development of modernization, it is becoming more and more common for families to share information about their loved ones’ illnesses. This is not only respectful to the patients, but it also allows for better care and support. There are many benefits to this change, and it is important that we continue to move towards a more open and honest culture when it comes to cancer.

"I believe that the face is just a natural landform. There are no facts to prove that aliens created that. Also there are also no facts to prove aliens didnt make that landform on Mars. I will still continue to believe that it is just a natural landform created by the planet Mars in earlier years.

I can prove my arguement in many ways. For example, it states in the text that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform"". Just that last sentence alone can make my arguement 10 times better. That statement proves to us it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states "" there was no alien monument after all."". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens.

As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that its just a natural landform on Mars. In the article it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you can see wwhat they were!"". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so called ""face"" or natural landform. Also then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not.

There are many other reasons why this arguement can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet Mars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. in fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on Mars.",0,"tensor([[-0.4851, -0.1492,  0.3889,  ..., -0.2502,  0.7853,  0.7200],

"It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know.

I think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Life gets irritating. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. We are always looking for something new. We never reach complete satisfaction. It is part of our nature, curiosity.

Even the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth.

Limiting what you do, causes you to shrink. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). Limitation in most cases is not a good thing.

Sure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like.

Doing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. We should always be going after growth.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2829, -0.0484,  0.2122,  ..., -0.0037,  0.3765,  0.3616],

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident from the various examples provided in the passage set. The suburban community of Vauban in Germany serves as a successful case study for limiting car usage (Rosenthal 1-9). The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Only two places are available for parking, which encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation like walking or biking. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal 3). This shows that by limiting car usage, residents are adopting healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

Another example of limiting car usage can be seen in the car-free day initiative in Bogota, Colombia (Selsky 21-28). On this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free from traffic congestion. This promotes alternative transportation methods and reduces smog. The success of this initiative is evident from the positive response it has received, with other cities in Colombia joining the event (Selsky 25). This demonstrates that limiting car usage has the potential to create a cultural shift towards more sustainable transportation choices.

Furthermore, limiting car usage has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal 5). By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and combat climate change. This is supported by the findings that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses, suggesting a shift in behavior towards reducing car dependency (Rosenthal 29-43).

In addition to the environmental benefits of limiting car usage, there are also social and economic advantages. For instance, by making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, people can have easier access to basic amenities like stores and services (Rosenthal 6). This reduces the need for long distance travel and reliance on cars. Moreover, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on public health by encouraging physical activity, as seen in Vauban, where people prefer walking or biking instead of driving (Rosenthal 3).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and include environmental, social, and economic benefits. By adopting policies and initiatives that promote alternative transportation methods and reduce car dependency, societies can create more sustainable and livable communities. The examples provided in the passage set, such as Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, highlight the potential for successful implementation of such measures. The shift towards reducing car dependency can play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change, improving public health, and creating more accessible and vibrant communities. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing such measures on a larger scale.",1,"tensor([[-0.4866, -0.2405, -0.6295,  ..., -0.1487,  0.1984, -0.2930],

"There is no clear answer when it comes to determining whether modern technology has made life more convenient or if life was better when technology was simpler. In many ways, modern technology has made life easier by providing conveniences such as cars, dishwashers, and smartphones. However, there are also negative aspects to modern technology, such as the negative effects on our health and the environment. Ultimately, it depends on the individual's perspective as to whether life is better or more convenient with modern technology.

From my perspective, modern technology has made life more convenient. I can easily communicate with people around the world, access information instantly, and travel to any place in the world with relative ease. For example, I can book a flight and find a hotel online in a matter of minutes, and I can communicate with people anywhere in the world via text, email, or social media. Additionally, I can easily purchase items online and have them delivered to my door.

While modern technology has made life more convenient, there are also negative aspects to consider. For example, our reliance on technology has led to the development of ""smartphones zombies,"" people who are so addicted to their phones that they walk around with their heads down, not paying attention to their surroundings. Additionally, our reliance on technology has had a negative impact on our health, as we are now spending more time indoors and are not getting enough exercise. Additionally, our use of technology has had a negative impact on the environment, as we are now producing more electronic waste than ever before.

In conclusion, while modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways, there are also negative aspects that should be considered. It ultimately depends on the individual's perspective as to whether life is better or more convenient with modern technology.

"Limiting car usage isnt such a bad idea. For starters, it helps keep a friendly enviroment, it also saves money and time for people to get to know eachother and talk a little more.

To begin with, limiting car usage would help keep a healthy, clean enviroment. In the article, 'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars' Elisabeth Rosenthal states that ""the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communtities, and legislatures are starting to act, if cautiously."" Which shows that less car usage would help protect our enviroment. Not only the enviromental agency, but the government and people agree. Also in the article 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert states that ""the smog cleared up enough Monday for the ruling French part to rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" giving us the fact that th esmog from the cars was hurting the eviroment and causing smog and reckless driving.

Secondly, limiting car usage would would save money and gas. In the article, 'Paris bans driving due to smog' Robert Duffer says that ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined-diesles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France."" We all know diesles an expensive gas, that more than half of France has to pay for just to get from place to place. It also proves that reckless driving and smog from cars can cause damage to someones pockets with fines.

Lastly, reduced driving can help people within the same community, get to know eachother better because your either riding around on a bike or walking, giving you the chance to associate with your neighborhood friends. As stated in the article 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota' , ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resteraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" which shows that driving had good aspects and helped the communty get along more.

In conclusion, thats why limiting car usage would have a good affect on our communities and a good affect on th ewhole world in general, because it helps keep a friendly enviroment, and it saves money and time for family and friends.",0,"tensor([[-0.5108, -0.2344, -0.3286,  ..., -0.5234,  1.1232, -0.1554],

"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how a new form of technology that can read human emotions was used to read the emotions of the Mona Lisa could be used to read other human emotions. Dr. Huang, from Beckman institute worked on the computer with other scientis. the computer was programed to read the expresions of humans by first making a 3D model of the face, along with all 44 major muscels in the face too.

How this would be valuable in the classroom. well it argues in ther artical how if this technology was available in all classrooms that this would ba able to help students learn in their own way or how the computer would be able to recognize the emotions that the student is expressing and would be able to change or modify the lesson for the sudent. if this sort of technology was available it would change the whole outlook on how we learn and change the whole outlook on the classroom. it would give students a better chance of learning and help how they learn,it would make each lesson personal to each student.

If this form of technology was made available then they major impact that it would have on schools and on students would be so grand that it would cahnge the face of learning. so therefor i do belive that the use of this technology is valuable in a classroom.",0,"tensor([[-0.2754, -0.0621, -0.0741,  ..., -0.6127,  0.7611,  0.1665],

"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the individual and their life experiences. However, in general, young people may enjoy life more than older people do because they are less burdened by responsibilities and are still experiencing the world in a new, exciting way.

For example, young people may not have to worry about paying bills, taking care of a family, or tending to a job. This leaves them more time to enjoy the simpler things in life, such as spending time with friends, exploring new places, or trying new things.

Additionally, young people are typically more optimistic and have a more positive outlook on life. They are not as jaded by the world and are still excited by the possibilities that life has to offer. This can lead to a more enjoyable experience overall.

While there are certainly older people who enjoy life to the fullest, in general, young people may be more inclined to do so. This is due to the various advantages that youth brings, such as a lack of responsibilities and a more positive outlook.

"intro and hook and thesis body body body conclusion restating thesis prompt is expository

From the minute we are born we are taught to always talk to a parent or guardian if we have an issue. But there are so many other people you could go to that would save you so much time and effort and they would give the exact same response as your parents. I believe you should always go to a separate opinion from that of your parental guardian and what you will find when you do so, is these other sources can teach you a lot more than your family and they have different experiences from those of your parents. your parents will always want the best and nothing more from you but think to yourself, ""do my parents really care about my issue or are they just trying to make me feel better about the problem at hand. So when you are done talking to your parents your decision is not made any easier, truthfully it's become a lot more challenging. Because you have been told what you expected them to say it's not helpful and you are disappointed.

I believe a great reason for going to another opinion for help is the fact that they won't sugarcoat the truth from you. They may not know you as well as your parents do and it could ultimately benefit you to hear the hard truth about the matter at hand. When you get constructive criticism from a peer it allows you to do a self evaluation on your problems and the different solutions you could use to solve your problems. That peer will always want the best out of you because it may be a close friend and they will understand you a bit better and they will always tell you your problem and try to help you understand what is wrong and what you should do. When you go to a second opinion you have to look back and think if you held back anything when you were talking to them, and if you didnt than you should expect them not to hold any of their emotions or feelings about the problem to you.

Another good reason for you to go seek a second opinion is that, they will always want to listen and seek understanding about your problems. If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of ""oh honey it's ok you will be fine"" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier

I believe that when you go to an alternative opinion about a concern they can show you a different perspective of the situation at hand. Which then helps you become a better problem solver in general and having that skill can make some of the tough decision seem very easy. The moment your eyes become fully opened to the different outcomes of what you could say or do based on a simple decision. You start to almost think more logically when you are given the task of answering the hard questions about yourself and you realize that all the decisions you make, impacts you and only you so don't worry about someone else when making a decision about your livelihood. This will ultimately always end up as a better decision because you took the time to hear another way of solving the issue and you can factor that into your decision making and how you will handle the problem you needed to get advice about.

I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before. That is why I believe going to a second opinion is beneficial towards your decision making and ultimately will help you in the long run with whatever issues arise.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2290, -0.0913,  0.0203,  ..., -0.2032,  0.3014,  0.1064],

"Is doing your best a problem? Personally I feel like there is no problem by doing your best. You should always want to do your best no matter what your doing. But,some people don't like to try they give up so easily that they don't want to do nothing no more. Like me I try my best but,sometimes I don't apply myself,and when I don't apply myself it turns out to bad results.

For Example,Paul George,and the Clippers played against Los Angeles Lakers,during the middle of the game Paul's shots weren't falling so he was having a low scoring game,but he still tried his best to get rebounds and steals to win the game for his team.

For another Example Generic_Name had a test,and there were some questions on there that he didn't understand. so he still worked through the problems,and took an educated guess and still tried his best and got a 75 on the test. usually Generic_Name get a B or above on tests but he forgot that the teacher told him that there would be some questions on the test that the class didn't know.

Final Example,my little sister is a basketball player like me and every Friday i go to ball handling to get my handles right. My little sister never done it before,and the class that we took was advance,it was easy for me because i been doing it for so long. But,i look to my right and i seen my sister struggling and my Trainer told her she was doing it wrong. So she dropped the ball and walked out the gym. After the training we got home,and i had a talk with her,and i told her i was gonna help her out. I showed her the moves outback and she started to get the hang of it,and now she's been practicing on the moves for weeks,and finally uses them in the game. But, she gave up the first time but, she was willing to try,and the results turned out fine because she tried her best.

You should always want to do your best and not give up because if you do your best the turn out would be great. It makes you want to work hard and do better at the things you want to do or get the things that you like. It makes you feel good because you know you tried to give it your all and wouldn't have to stress about it.",0,"tensor([[-0.1820, -0.5274, -0.1228,  ..., -0.1302,  0.4327, -0.0363],

"In the excerpt the author talks about how even though going to venus will be a challenging journey it will aslo be a meaningful one. Through paragraphs 1-8 he paints a perfect picture of what NASA's has tried to do and what they are currently doing. He starts by explaining that yes, the living conditons on Venus are not ideal but they are survivable. Through the previous voyages to Venus, they have been able to establish that Venus is not a stable enough planet for them to completely land advanced technology there yet. The author tells us that in the past NASA has sent rovers and stuff up to the surface of Venus to get us a better view of our galaxies ""evening star''.

But within hours the space craft was lost and in a way killed due to the harsh conditions on Venus. Taking all that into consideration, NASA is planning on devising a better plan to rediscover and reexplore Venus. They are brainstorming on a way to make a device that can hover 30 or so miles above the surface of Venus. That distance will be the equivalant to jets and commercial airplanes flying over storms here on earth. The author succesfully persuaded me to believe Venus is worth exploring after reading this excerpt.

He did so by descriptively creating a scene in my head of Venus being Earth's equal. He talks about there being valleys, hills, and craters on Venus's surface just like they are here on Earth. He also goes into detail about how there is a strong possability that long ago Venus could have been covered in water that could have supported various life. There is also a strong possibility that if Venus can support our earth needs, then it could possibly be supporting someone elses. With further research and explorations we could find out if there truly is other life forms other than us.

In conclusion, Venus is worth going back to and doing a deeper investigation of what the planet really can do. I do believe that if anything would happen to earth it would be in our best bet to be able to flee to Venus. The author did a amazing job of supporting the idea of conducting better research on Venus by painting a vivid image into my head. Through his use of words and use of back story, he helps show that with enough motivation and dedication. We can transform Venus and its rough planetary conditons into another Earth.",0,"tensor([[-0.4166, -0.2174, -0.0018,  ...,  0.0234,  0.8914,  0.2000],

"The Facial Action Coding System technology is a new thing to detect how people are feeling using the computer. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it teaches students how to use new technology. Using this system shows the students what all jobs are avalible in the technology field too.

Using technology like this can help improve the way students use computers and help them get jobs. in the future. Most new jobs rely on some sort of technology or require you to know how to use it. With this new tech people might have a job lined up that they did not know about.

This technology can also be good for detecting if someone is feeling bad or is depressed. They can use this as a form of helping people out if no one can tell they are sad. For instence in paragraph three ""Eckman had classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."". If they can use this to treat people who are not happy it can solve a bunch of problems in the future.

Since they can use this technology to see peoples real emotions they can tell students' emotional expressions. If they are sad they can do something to make them happy again and get better grades.

"Is it really, good if u dont use a car day to day? People in Europe have started this new trend of having different suburbs to not have cars. Now, Paris is banning driving due to smog. Also, Clolombia now has a car-free day that made people bike, hike and aslo take buses to work making the streets have less traffic jams. The U.S, one of the most car used nations, has been going down, and in April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was the same as in January 1995. Experts are also thinking that if they encourage people to reduce the usage of cars, that it may help the greenhouse gases problem gradualy.

So one suburb that is already been established and made an car-free zone is Vauban, Germany. This suburb has minimal parking spots and people have easy access to stores. A woman said,

""When i had a car i always tense. I'm much happier this way""

. This movement of making places car-free is called

""smart plannig""

. ""In the U.S the Envoirmantal Protection Agency is promoting

""car redused""

communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.""

In Paris, people were fined if they did not leave their car at home. This was put into place, because smog was intensifying. Also, smog is more in Paris than in any other capital in Europe. Delivery companies lost revenue, but electric cars and public transit was free of charge. After, the smog cleared the odd ruling was rescinded.

Colombia had an idea that was put into place one day and made a change in everybody. They made a program which is a car-free day which made people go hiking, biking and they rode buses to work. It made the streets clearer. It was put into place so that it woulg help the reduction of smog. This peogram helps people to know other ways to transport themselves without cars.

The U.S is the nation that has the most cars used. So, now they are trying to decrease the use of cars. A study showed that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.

"Is studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In my opinion if you would like to devote your life to the study of venus and go preform test on Venus then what ever makes you happy. How ever the author is more on the side of why go and waist all of the resources needed to go to Venus.

In the begining of this passage the author states ""

human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, wether its a crowded city like NewYork, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And dont get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.

Now, lets discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a lose, lose situation. Why buy these isanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.

The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all of the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.

Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Less cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With less cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who dont even have a license.

All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you dont have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place. Limit your car usage and make the word a better place on step at a time.",0,"tensor([[ 2.1718e-01, -1.7159e-01,  2.4186e-01,  ..., -2.8232e-01,

"Archery has been a popular sport and pastime for centuries. It is often seen as an activity exclusive to the privileged, but with the right equipment and guidance, it can be pursued by anyone who is willing to put in some effort. Archery provides a unique form of physical exercise that can help improve coordination and muscle strength. Additionally, practitioners of archery learn various techniques that are necessary to hit their targets accurately. In its simplest form, archery involves shooting arrows towards a target from a distance using only the power generated by one's bow arm. This requires accuracy in both hand-eye coordination and shot release technique-- two skills which must be mastered before any significant progress may be made in this sport. A key component of an archer's success lies in his or her ability to maintain proper posture throughout each shot; incorrect posture will lead to inconsistent results at best, while poor technique could result in injury over time if not corrected quickly enough. Furthermore, because most bows use recurve technology (wherein they bend back upon itself), great attention must also be paid when drawing back on the bowstring; too much tension could snap it suddenly without warning!. Aside from physical prowess and technical mastery of draw-and-release mechanics, another important aspect of successful archery rests within mental focus. The spirit behind the practice encourages individuals to become aware not just of their shots' trajectories but also their environment around them -- wind speed influences arrow flight dramatically so staying attuned with changes happening outside plays an integral role here as well! Learning how one’s emotions impact performance is another part where mental fortitude comes into play: if you allow fear/anxiety control your aim then chances are good accuracy will suffer greatly - something all aspiring champions should keep mindfully present always during their training sessions!. The advent of modern day competitive tournaments have allowed for more people than ever before access into this ancient competition - now widely celebrated worldwide through Olympic games every

"Some people like to imagine the unreal, so when a mysterious face figure was spotted on Cydonia the public blew up. Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didn't seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.

Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesn't mean it's and acient alien artifact. Becuase of technlogy and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didn't look the exact same as they did in person, well, this might be the same case. ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" The camera might have taken the picture in a way that the human eye couldn't see. It might have added extra, or inhanced shadows making it look like a face. You'd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with eyes, a nose and even a mouth.

Meanwhile back down on planet earth some people may be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Cydonia people don't know what type of strange weather or temperature changes they could've had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what they want to believe and not look at the facts. They like to ignore whats really there and think what they want to think to create some type of excitment in their life. ""It has starred ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.

However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable so I can see why people first thought it had to do with a conspricy theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what you want to believe just because it is exciting.

In conclusion, as exciting as it would be for this is odd looking figure to be, or have anything to do with aliens, it's nothing but a landform that looks like an alien face. And because of technolgy and peoples creative minds its features were inhanced and made to look real.

"The face you think was created by aliens was not, because we have no evidence of aliens throught all of our travels in space. The face is just a natural landform on Mars. If you think that NASA wants to hide this for their research your wrong. If NASA released that there was alien lifeforms on Mars their funding would be increased by a lot. The photos may look likes the face was created by something, but it is a naturally formed mesa. It looks like a face because the shadows form what look to be like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. If there have been spacecrafts surveying the land on Mars then why have there not been any pictures sent back of alien lifeform.

If the face was created by aliens where, the aliens should be nearby unless they can travel faster than anything the Earth has. The face could not have been created by aliens because there is not any lifeform on Mars that is not microscopic. We havesurveyed Mars several times and not seen anything proving alien liforns except for this face. If there are aliens then there should be more evidence than a face, which is most likely a mesa. If there are aliens and they built this face, it had to mean something to them. If the face meant something to the aliens then they would be found near it. The Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho is a lave dome that takes the place of an isolated mesa and is about the same height as the face on Mars.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough to the face to get a good picture. It was a cloudless day, so the picture was very clear. Each pixel measured to about 1.56 meters. The Viking 1 photo measured about 43 meters per pixel. There were no markings on the face from an alien lifeform.

The Mars Global Surveyor looks straight down on the planet taking pictures and sending them to NASA. Since the Mars Global Surveyor only does 2.5 km-wide strips it does not pass over the face very often. Even though it does not pass over the face very often the Mars Global Surveyor covers a lot of land and has not seen any aliens.

That will cause them to get into the following accidents: car crash, running someone over, or going off the road. These accidents have happened before including if there is a kid riding with you. It will also cause meager injures to the drive and the passengers even the kid. That is why we create cars that have a free hand mode so that way you call or text someone without looking at the phone. They even have phone holders that you can attach to the fane of your car.

For example I am a person who is always on my phone everyday. One day I am driving my kids to their friends house but then I get a text message from my friend. I pick up the phone and I read the text that means i'm paying more attention to my phone and not to the road. At that moment when I'm reapplying to his text suddenly a car pulls up and I try to slam on the brakes but then I crash into the car. I am very injured from the crash and my kids are also in pain that is what happens when you are texting and driving.

99% of people have gotten into this kind of accident all because they were texting and driving at the sametime. If we all didn't have are phones when we are driving we could avoid these accidents and be safe. Even Some people who are texting and driving can even cause death to a person because they got ran over by a car. Phones are a distraction when you are driving because it claimed up to 3,450 live back in 2016 alone and it still is. It also caused 391,000 injured people in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.

Teens are the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes when texting. Back in 2013 about 1.2 million of car crashes have occurred all because of cell phones usage while driving statistics that had shown that this kind of behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Texting while driving statistics show that doing this behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. That is why when people are behind the wheel they shouldn't have there phone when driving.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1543, -0.2163,  0.0733,  ..., -0.6575,  0.5990, -0.1913],

"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?.

Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time.

Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on.

Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo,

assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time.

Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay,

but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus ,

it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group.

In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful.            ",0,"tensor([[-0.0754,  0.0272, -0.2277,  ..., -0.7894,  0.3466,  0.4112],

"The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit by including many details that, despite the dangers of venus, we have ways in which we can get past those dangers to complete a fully devolped exploration of Venus. There are a few ways the author goes about doing this: telling us how venus couldve been like earth, how NASA has a few ideas on how to make the exploration safe and about the different technology they scientist would use to study venus.

Long ago venus couldve been considered another earth-like planet of life. in the text it states, "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This would encourage any scientist to want to explore more into the planet to try and figure out what went wrong, even though it is close to the sun but still has earth like features, what is the problem? Venus still, to this day, has features of earth like mountains and valleys and rocky sediment, but is still not liveable on because of some conditions. In the end it could be like another planet we could visit because it is so close to earth, but we have to find some way to get there safely.

In order to do a successful research of venus, you have to first get there safely, and NASA has an idea to do that. The author introduces NASA's idea in paragraph 5 stating ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of

Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" Just like our airplanes and jets, scientist would be able to float above the atmosphere of venus because of the risky temperatures and conditions. It would allow them to avoid unfiendly ground conditions and stay out of the way for anything to come. Even though it wouldn't protect you from every little hassle of Venus, the air pressure would still be close enough to that of earth and the conditions will still be survivable for humans.

Once you get there, you would need something to conduct your research or study with, so having durable equipment would help you get your job done. First of all, the author states in the text ""Some siplified electronics made of silicone carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This would allow scientist to conduct an expirement well enough to find out more about venus. They could use the electronics made of silicone carbide to help them make longer observations , than those of modern equipment that would melt rather quickly because of Venus's conditions. In adition to the silicone carbide, NASA has also been working on bringing back mechanical computers, used in WW II that use levers and gears to make calculations. Those computers are more resistant to heat and pressure.

And finally with the idea of how Venus could've been like earth, the different ways on how to make the exploration safe and the different technology that would be used to study venus, one can conclude that venus is not only worthy of a pursuit but is also a way of creating value and expansion.",0,"tensor([[-0.6174,  0.0936, -0.5444,  ..., -0.1491,  0.6914,  0.2429],

"Title: Promoting Sustainability Through Reduced Car Usage

In the face of numerous environmental and public health challenges, limiting car usage has been proposed as a strategy to promote more sustainable and livable communities. Evidence from various sources across the globe supports the implementation of this model in both developed and developing nations, citing benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Residents of Vauban, a German suburb, have successfully adopted a car-free lifestyle, evidenced by 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). The elimination of cars’ incessant noise has resulted in a serene environment where the chirping of birds and the chatter of children constitute the primary sounds (Rosenthal, 2009). Vauban’s model of “smart planning” not only discourages car usage but also encourages an active lifestyle through increased walking and cycling. Such planning initiatives can help other cities combat air pollution, a significant environmental issue that arrived in the spotlight when Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to hazardous smog levels (Duffer, 2014).

Car usage restriction, as seen in Vauban and on dysfunctional, smog-filled days in Paris, has also led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a known contributor to climate change (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014). The decrease in car usage, and a shift to more energy-efficient transportation methods, reduce environmental impact and can significantly benefit public health.

Similar outcomes have been observed in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, where the annual “Day Without Cars” campaign encourages residents to use alternative forms of transport, significantly reducing traffic and resultant pollution (Selsky, 2002). The campaign has inspired an overall urban improvement effort, including expanding bicycle lanes and revitalizing public spaces, uplifting the urban quality of life and further promoting a culture of sustainability.

American behavior illustrates a changing trend regarding car usage, heralding beneficial implications for curbing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). In the long run, this could have positive effects on air quality, urban densification, and public health. Additionally, new and innovative commuting arrangements are emerging due to the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps, which provide easier access to shared rides and public transportation (Rosenthal, 2013). 

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are extensive and impactful. Reduced congestion, enhanced public health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a generally improved quality of life can be achieved by fostering a society that values sustainability and propels a shift away from auto-centric communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that a change is feasible and can lead to substantial benefits. Encouraging this transformative shift in urban planning and personal transportation is paramount for a sustainable, more livable future.",1,"tensor([[-0.4699, -0.2963, -0.3666,  ..., -0.3135,  0.3110, -0.1142],

"The prevalence of digital technology in modern society has had a significant impact on interpersonal communication, with many people communicating through digital mediums instead of face-to-face conversations. While there are advantages and disadvantages to this, it is important for individuals to understand how their decisions can affect the quality of these interactions and the overall health of their relationships. In an effort to better understand our relationship with technology, we must first examine its effect on traditional modes of communication. The use of smartphones and other devices have made it easier than ever before to communicate while also allowing us to avoid uncomfortable or confrontational situations by simply cutting off contact when necessary. This makes it difficult for effective resolution when issues arise within a relationship as those involved may feel they lack the ability or courage to discuss them in person due to potential embarrassment or even fears that their conversation may be misinterpreted via text message. We cannot discount the opportunity cost either; spending time online often takes away from physical activity, which is critical for maintaining both mental and physical well-being. On the other hand, digital communication has enabled us access people across great distances who otherwise would be unreachable without having costly long distance phone calls or expensive plane tickets - making it possible for those separated by hundreds if not thousands miles apart maintain some sort connection despite being removed from one another geographically speaking. Furthermore, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter make it easy for individuals around world come together under a single platform where pictures videos can shared instantly among family friends alike - connecting loved ones no matter what corner globe they're located in just few clicks button away.

"The number of positive connotations that limiting car usage around the world would have on society is infinite. It would lower congestion, promote more healthy and efficient means of travel, and it would reduce emissions by a very large factor. People around the world are turning towards methods of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile. Maybe one day cars will be pass?

According to a study in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after prohibiting driving for a few days, and fining those who disregarded the experiment. Less congestion led to less road noise, which, in turn, made people ""happier."" It created a safer environment for children and parents alike. Having fewer cars on the road encouraged people to go outside whenever they could. Citizens of Vauban, a city in Germany, are taking this newfound peacefulness to an extreme. Driving is forbidden in their city and there are not any available parking spaces in the event that they still own a car! Vauban is an example of a city that was built based on ""smart planning."" More communities are adopting this ideal and try to have everything located within walking distance of a person's home. This encourages people to get to where they need to go without the use of an automobile. People nowadays also have the technology to communicate with others electronically, so that reduces the need for an automobile to get from point A to point B. Why waste the time and money on gas to communicate with someone when you could send them an email or text for a low cost in a matter of seconds?

This being said, limiting car usage promotes public transportation services. In Bogota, 118 miles worth of bicycle paths have been built in an effort to steer people away from automobiles. This encourages people to get from place to place via a healthy and fun means of transport. Undoubtedly, people are more likely to stay close to home without the accessibility of cars, so limiting the use of cars saves the time that would be spent on the roads.

Limiting car usage has major benefits when it comes to carbon emissions and environmental problems. President Obama has wanted to curb the United States' emissions and so far his goal is a success. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Smog has been severely reduced in countries around the globe since plans to limit car usage have gone into effect.

Limiting car usage might seem like something that ""would be good in theory,"" and it will definitely be a hard thing for today's generation to wrap their head around, but the positive impacts it would have on society are limitless. Congestion and emissions would be reduced, time spent commuting would be saved, and the world would be a much safer place to live in overall. Limiting car usage everywhere is definitely something to think about.",0,"tensor([[-4.2789e-02, -2.0073e-01, -4.4450e-04,  ..., -1.4545e-01,

"Cell phones Vs Driving

I believe that people being allowed to operate a motor vehicle must never also be allowed to have their phone in their hand while doing so. Cell phones make driving much more dangerous by distracting the driver from the road. In 2019 The state of Georgia made it illegal for driver's to have their phones in their hand while driving. This law is called the ""Hands-Free"" law. Since this law has been put into place a lot more Georgia driver's have been able to reach their destinations.

I'm on the side of banning any amount of cellphone usage while driving, texting and driving is extremely dangerous and has been proven time and time again of being one of the most common causes of death in the United states. Fun fact actually, more people die from texting and driving than from sharks... So why do we keep letting people do something that we know is more dangerous than swimming with sharks? Because people nowadays are almost addicted to being on their phones. People have become too consumed in the fake reality of phones and social media that they value texting while driving more than their own life it seems. And because of that I strongly believe that driver's should NOT be able to use their phone in any capacity while driving. Sure they may be helpful with navigation and helping you find out where to go, but there are also a million other different distractions that come with the cell phone like the notifications, emails, ringtones, snapchats, and tweets that also come with it and are completely unnecessary while driving.

I hope that society comes to their senses and realizes how dangerous and unnecessary phones are when it comes time to drive a motor vehicle. A text can always wait, but someone's life cannot, a text or phone call is never worth the life of a person. I think that banning all cell phone usage in motor vehicles is a necessity and it should be implemented as soon as possible.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2077, -0.2629, -0.3643,  ..., -0.2002,  0.4922,  0.2078],

"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is usually a good idea. Talking to more than one person allows you to get different perspectives on the situation. Each person you consult might know something the others do not or have had unique experiences that provide valuable insights. Getting a variety of viewpoints helps ensure you don't miss important factors to consider or unintentionally narrow your focus too much based on the opinion of just one person. 

Family and friends can give helpful advice but may be biased based on their relationship to you. Speaking to more impartial sources expands the range of opinions. Someone outside your inner circle is less emotionally invested and may notice things those closest to you overlook. Balance is important when deciding between listening mostly to friends who want to support you emotionally versus strangers who offer a less biased analysis. Considering both types of advice together tends to yield the wisest choice. 

Comparing what different people say can also help identify common themes or areas of disagreement. This highlights which issues or factors elicited consistent versus varying reactions. Useful information often emerges through exploring reasons behind disagreements too. Investigating opposing views challenges assumptions and prevents you from dismissing certain options prematurely without due consideration. Seeing an issue from multiple perspectives is key to making a fully informed choice.

In summary, seeking advice from more than one trusted source increases the likelihood of making the choice that fits your unique situation the best. No single person knows everything relevant to a complex decision, but together multiple advisors can provide a well-rounded pool of input to draw from. Taking the time to gather varied opinions pays off in helping select the alternative most likely to provide the results you want in the long run.",1,"tensor([[-0.1800, -0.4258, -0.2894,  ..., -0.1514, -0.1243,  0.8054],

"Reducing the amount of cars used would benefit the fellow citizens greatly. Limiting car usage would decrease the amount of pollution in the air greatly, because they are among the main causes of emissions into the air among many countries. A better environment for the citizens would arise because the infrastructure of many cities would improve and the people would exercise more, therefore becoming healthier. Also, congestion would dramatically decrease because less people would be on the road which also leads to less car accidents so less people would be getting injured from a car accident.

Car emissions all over the world are among the main causes for the air pollution and greenhouse gasses. In cities llike Paris the air pollution rose so much that there was a temporal driving ban on the whole city. This ban eventually cleared the air but if this could happen in one city it is more than likely to happen again in another city. These car emissions are clearly a large part of this air pollution as Elisabeth Rosenthal shows the U.S has a fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the abundant amount of cars. Limiting the car usage would clearly diminish the amount of emissions in the air and prevent these large amounts of smog and pollution to form in the air that the people are breathing.

In the city Bogota a carfree day was hosted to promote public transportation, and it had created many benefits to the city's infrastructure. With more money coming in from these public transportation the government has more money to fix and improve upon the city's infrastructure. The sidewalks were fixed, more restaurants were opened, and more people attended parks, and sports centers. If more cities implemented this carfree program for longer than a day the people would be becoming healthier and the environment would be a lot safer with better sidewalks, and better infrastructure in general. Also with these new buildings being created more jobs would naturally also be created therefore unemployment would also be decreasing in the cities that are restricting cars. In Vauban, a city almost no cars, the citizens live happy with a rectangular shape to their city to maintain everything close and a small walk away from almost everything, therefore the infrastructure for the city is clearly well built and no cars are needed.

The restriction of cars would also make the roads a lot safer considering there are less cars to crash into or cause accidents. As shown from the Paris ban on cars, congestion had decreased sixty percent from what it was originally. The only people driving would be the conductors of the public transportation vehicles, therefore a majority of the drivers on the streets would be experienced and not be drunk while driving. The decrease in congestion would also lead to a much more efficient mode on transportation from the busses, and they would travel much faster to their destinations.

With the restriction of car usage the positive benefits created would immensely improve the living conditions and environment that the citizens live in.

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in car-intensive areas, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For instance, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free community where 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in cleaner air and less pollution for residents. Similarly, during a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion decreased by 60% and pollution levels dropped. These examples show that limiting car usage can have a direct positive impact on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The passage set highlights that car emissions contribute to poor air quality, leading to smog and respiratory issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and decrease health problems associated with pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participated by hiking, biking, or taking public transportation to work. This event showcased the potential for car-free initiatives to improve public health by reducing pollution levels and creating clean and breathable environments.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage set mentions the concept of ""smart planning"" and creating compact suburbs that are designed to be less dependent on cars. This includes placing stores within walking distance, improving public transportation options, and reducing the amount of parking space. By implementing these changes, communities can become more walkable, reduce the need for car usage, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Vauban, Germany, is an example of a community that has adopted these principles and created a car-free environment. This has resulted in residents feeling happier and less stressed, as mentioned by a media trainer and mother of two in the passage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit society as a whole. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote public health. Additionally, creating communities that are less dependent on cars can lead to increased sustainability and accessibility. It is important for societies to embrace initiatives that encourage alternative forms of transportation and limit car usage in order to create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"tensor([[-0.5359, -0.1630, -0.7195,  ..., -0.4927,  0.1560,  0.1636],

"There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the candidate would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be a winnertakesall situation.

Most importantly the candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The representative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. george W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.

Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each candidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the opportunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.

Furthermore the candidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winnertakesall which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The candidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.

In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a candidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the candidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.",0,"tensor([[-0.5647, -0.1872,  0.2807,  ..., -0.6091,  0.9219,  0.2391],

"This goes out to the senator of florida. I think we need to chang to voteing way. We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot.

Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. And dont likethat because the what the heck is happening if were not acktually voting for the president and just the electors. Like for real then whats the point of voting if were not getting what we want. When the goverment is all about giveing the people what they want.

"Education has been a hot topic in recent decades as it has become increasingly clear that the quality of an individual's education can determine their success or failure in life. It is no surprise, then, that many people are passionate about finding ways to improve educational outcomes. One such method is personalized learning, which tailors instruction to each student’s unique skills and needs. This approach stands apart from the traditional one-size-fits-all model of schooling by relying on technology and data analytics to create lessons tailored to each student’s strengths and weaknesses. Personalized learning begins with assessments aimed at identifying students' academic abilities, interests, personalities,and other factors that may influence how they learn best. From there, teachers use this information – along with reports generated by computer programs – to develop curricula specifically for each student’s needs. For example, if a student struggles with math but works well independently on computers, teachers could provide him or her with online tutorials instead of regular classroom lectures. In addition to helping students stay engaged and motivated while learning material more successfully than they would under traditional methods; personalized learning also allows instructors greater flexibility in assigning coursework according to individual students' capability levels without having to adapt entire class curriculum for everyone else simultaneously . The concept of personalized learning is gaining traction among educators due its potential benefits over traditional teaching strategies: it promotes both academic excellence and social development among all learners regardless of background or ability level; encourages independent exploration and discovery through self-directed projects; helps build relationships between teacher/student as well as peers; enhances problem solving skills through hands on activities; fosters collaboration within teams ;and facilitates progress tracking so teachers can see exactly what areas need extra attention while guiding students towards meeting their own personal goals throughout the school year. Though still relatively new compared with conventional teaching models ,personalized learning offers tremendous promise when implemented correctly because it emphasizes adaptive approaches based on knowledge rather than standardized instruction alone .

"Should our way of voting in the United States be changed? The way we vote today is through the electoral college. Each president get a certain number of electoral votes and that is how we vote on specific leaders. The Electoral College process was established in our Constitution as a compromise. This way we could elect our president by a vote in Congress and election of our president by citizens who qualify. Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College?

First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is manditory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen based opon the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential electon held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate's elecotrs. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state and with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

In addition, the pocess of the Electoral College should be changed. The are even a number of Presidents that tried to abolish the Electoral College. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adn the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing it. It is proven that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Most voters today are significantly uninformed. Some do not even know what or whom they are voting for. Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states do require to so identification, although others do not. A direct election would be more specified and easier for people to choose and use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them. There are multiple errors in the voting process. There are certain people that do not even posess a high school degree, let alone a college degree, that vote just because they want to. The is a massive suply of ignorance and pride that fall into play with the Electoral College.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president they choose, but for a slate of electors, who in turn, elect the president. For instance, if you wanted to vote for a specific person you would vote for a slate of electors pledged to that person. This method of voting is curupt and should be abolished. The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, adn that those electors could alwyas defy the will of the people.

In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say but the Electoral College in general was a mistake.",0,"tensor([[-0.5999, -0.2342,  0.1664,  ..., -0.3422,  0.8288,  0.5419],

"With the rapid development of technology, it is becoming increasingly easy to engage in online shopping. Online shopping has become a popular and convenient way for people to purchase goods from all over the world. While most people associate online shopping with convenience, ease of access, and variety of product options there are several potential risks that consumers should be aware of before making an online purchase. One risk associated with purchasing items over the internet is data security. Online retailers often collect personal information such as name, address, email address and credit card details when transactions occur which makes customers vulnerable to identity theft or fraudulent activity on their accounts. As a result, shoppers must practice safe internet browsing habits while searching for items they wish to buy whether it’s through researching the company’s privacy policy or taking steps such as using secure payment methods like PayPal or Apple Pay rather than entering your credit card information directly into an unfamiliar website's checkout page. Furthermore, shoppers should always check a site's trustworthiness by looking for customer reviews prior to making any purchases on new sites that they don't recognize so as not give away sensitive financial information without knowing if you can really trust them first. Another risk facing consumer who shop online pertains to delivery reliability; when buying something off the internet customers are essentially trusting third party companies like FedEx or UPS with delivering their item correctly and safely on-time even though in some cases products will take weeks (or months) longer than expected due to various reasons like extreme weather conditions or customs regulations etc… To help mitigate these risks buyers should always read up about different shipping policies offered by each store/website before committing  to make sure that their order will arrive promptly since many stores offer refund policies if packages do not reach within a certain time frame which may also vary depending on where you live geographically too! Additionally it may be beneficial for buyers who value speediness look into express courier services such as DHL Express instead since typically these types of service providers have

"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",0,"tensor([[ 0.4173, -0.2683,  0.5519,  ..., -0.6220,  1.0979, -0.1087],

    Working in a group can be beneficial in many ways. For one, having more minds to work on a particular task can make the work more effective than if one person were to work on it alone. Working with a team can also help increase self-confidence, as there is a sense of support and encouragement from the other members when tackling a challenge. Lastly, working in a group has the added benefit of creating an environment where everyone can interact and exchange ideas openly rather than a single person needing to work in isolation. 

On the other hand, working alone has some advantages of its own. Most notably, one can maintain total control and responsibility for a project without having to consult other people about decisions which can be helpful for complex tasks. Additionally, when working in isolation, one can focus intently on the task without distractions from outside conversations. This can help improve the speed and accuracy of the work. 

In conclusion, working in groups and working alone both have their own advantages, so it is important to consider the specific task at hand before deciding which approach is best.",1,"tensor([[-0.1538, -0.4821, -0.7273,  ..., -0.2253, -0.3205,  0.9088],

"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.

For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.

If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.

and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.

For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.

Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.

I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,

So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage

We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.

One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.

So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.

It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.

The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",0,"tensor([[-0.1426, -0.1645,  0.3248,  ..., -0.3309,  1.0693, -0.2951],

"We use cars every day, but have we ever actually stopped to realize the stress and pollution they cause? Now think just how many advantages there would be if we limited car usage. There would be less stress, it would be less dangerous, and there would be less pollution. Not only would we be helping the environment, but also helping to protect our families from the harm cars can cause.

Stress we all experience it. It's become such a big factor in everyones life. One of the most stressful things is sitting in a traffic jam when you are already late to work, but think, if we limited the usage of cars, there wouldn't be so many traffic jams. In the third essay, by Andrew Selsky, a man and his wife state ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress"". Traffic jams are stressful no matter where you are going. They make you impatient and easily annoyed. Stress has a very big impact on your health too. Sitting in a traffic jam every day and being under that kind of stress can start to affect your health poorly.

Cars are a very dangerous piece of machine. They are manmade and sometimes they have flaws. Some of these flaws might be a quick fix, but others may be fatal. Many people have lost their lives while at the wheel of a car. Many people have lost loved ones to terrible car crashes. Limiting the usage of cars will end up resulting in a lower crash rate. With a lower crash rate we can ensure the safety of our families, more than we ever could before.

According to the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Pollution is a dangerous thing. It may seem like nothing, but it has a bigger threat than any of us realize. Pollution is taking away all of the clean air we have left to breathe. With power plants emitting such harmful fumes, and now cars, our air is being polluted quicker then we ever thought possible. Helping to reduce car usage will reduce the pollution in the air. We will be, not only helping our environment, but also helping our children. As kids grow older, we can help them have a healthy earth, and clean air to breathe.

Considering all of the advantages to decreasing the usage of cars, we may want to join in on what parts of Europe and Colombia have already started to work on. According to the article by Andrew Selsky, Colombia has a ""Day Without Cars"" that happens once every year. This has been happening for three straight years. In German, there is a suburb where people live, and most do not own cars. While in Paris they have also started having a day of no driving. This has helped to clean up their air and decrease the amount of stress people go through while driving. Cars are very convienent, but are they so convienent when they cause so much harm.",0,"tensor([[-0.1973, -0.1245, -0.2968,  ..., -0.6717,  0.6769, -0.0997],

The invention of the telephone changed the world forever, ushering in a new era of communication. In the late 1800s, inventor Alexander Graham Bell debuted the prototype for the first practical telephone, allowing individuals to transmit their voice through a system of wires. Thus began the journey of what would become the ubiquitous device that powers long-distance conversations today. 

The progression of the telephone over the past century or so has been astounding. Advances in digital and networking technology have allowed for smaller, more powerful phones to be developed, as well as the incorporation of sophisticated features such as voicemail, texting, and phone apps. This has enabled users to stay connected with one another no matter where they are in the world. 

On one side, the telephone has had a largely positive effect on communication and relationships. People can now stay in contact over long distances, be a part of global conversations, and keep up with the news from around the world. On the other hand, it has also had some negative impacts. Technology has resulted in an overwhelming amount of media consumption, leading to an increase in stress and anxiety among users. It has also resulted in decreased attention spans and information overload, which can lead to a lack of focus. 

Overall, the invention of the telephone and its progression over the years has brought about both positive and negatives impacts on society. While its ability to keep people connected is undeniably valuable, it is important to be mindful of the negative effects of technology that it can create and take the necessary steps to mitigate them.",1,"tensor([[-0.4904, -0.1888, -0.5851,  ..., -0.2473,  0.2249,  0.3487],

"When it comes to the topic of youth sports, there is a lot of debate surrounding the positive and negative effects they can have on children. On one hand, youth sports provide young people with an opportunity to stay physically fit, as well as develop important skills such as teamwork and communication. However, there are also potential drawbacks that must be taken into consideration when participating in organized sports at a young age. The most obvious benefit to youth sports participation is increased physical fitness. This is especially true for team sports like basketball or soccer which involve running back and forth across the court or field during games. Regular exercise helps keep kids healthy by improving their cardiovascular endurance and strength while burning calories that can contribute to weight gain over time if left unchecked. Additionally, being involved in athletics often encourages children to make better dietary choices due to their awareness of what works best for their performance in competition. Another advantage associated with playing organized sports from an early age is learning how to collaborate effectively with others on a team setting towards common goals . Being part of a squad teaches athletes discipline through making sure everyone follows instructions from coaches , working together cohesively during practice sessions , and supporting each other even when things don’t go according plan . Furthermore , taking part in competitive matches help youngsters build character by having them become more resilient under pressure since success isn’t guaranteed all times . Finally , these activities may open up potential employment opportunities later down line due coaching/refereeing jobs or providing scouts/recruiters with material proof that they are capable performing at high levels athletically speaking . Nevertheless , there are some drawbacks related playing competitively while still growing up aside from physical injuries potentially sustained along way such strained muscles here or broken bones there . With so much focus placed winning victories regarding individual teams (coaches often prioritize this before any else) players sometimes forget bigger picture entirely i e gaining life lessons instead favor concentrating solely stats end result which might lead unhealthy obsession perfection

"Dear State Senator, ""The Electoral college is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country. I feel this way because the people of America do not really make the decision of who becomes President their vote just goes to a slate of electors. People may say that the Electoral College is fair but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican candidates and thats not fair at all.

The first reason I think the Electoral college should be abolished is because the deciding factor of who becomes Americas President doesn't come from the people it comes from the Electoral college. Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to ""election by popular vote."" Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would receive 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the candidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California.",0,"tensor([[-0.6066, -0.1411, -0.6132,  ..., -0.2845,  0.3611,  0.5223],

Using technology can have some intense effect on peoples health issues. Technology can cause people to perform bad things.

Technology can change the way people live their lives. When people are using technology, they can't focus on what the other person is saying. Technology cause people of losing communication with their parents or their friends. Young people use technology more than old people. Young people are addicted to technology which is bad for them. School's do not like to let students use their cellphones during classes, because they will not focus on learning anything. If someone could take the technology away from young people, they would not communicate with their parents or not even make an eye contact with them. Technology can cause a bad habit for them.

Using technology can have some bad effect on peoples health. A lot of people die in car accidents on account of them using technology while driving a car. People can get addicted to their technology devices, which is bad for their eyes. Using a lot of technology can cause people to go blind. Young people don't get enough sleep because they use their phones and stay up late. Some parents let their kids to use technology and avoid what it can do to their kids. Some parents do care about their kids health issues and they take their devices away. Technology can cause people to get hurt.

Technology can cause people to perform illegal actions. Technology have a very negative effect on the peoples lives. Many people kill themselves because the media tells them to do so. People see negative effects of the technology and then they use them. People kill because of technology. Using technology can turn people aggressive, independent, and impudent.

People shouldn't use technology a lot because it effects them emotionally. Technology is bad for people because it changes the way people live their lives.

"The world has become a plastic bag of pollution, sufficating its inhabitants and holding in all the problems in this world. The major, and simply solved, problem is automobiles. Citizens should reduce car usage to improve there lives and take advantages of the benfits that follow. The people of Germany, Paris, Columbia, and The United States has, at least, tasted the benefits of such a simple change.

Vauban, Germany has recreated itself to become a car-free community. Residents agree with and support the cause saying "" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way(doc 1)."" The stressors caused by money problems and dangers from cars, make the people of the world stressed. In addition to the relaxing effect of this kind of community, this life style reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emission expelled from tailpipes that is ""choking cities(doc 1)."" In this specially made community, cities are denser, with more public transportation and overall a cheaper way of life. The Enviormental Protection Agency agrees, this is a change for the better.

Paris, France has gone to the nessisary extent of a partial driving ban to clear the air from the cancerous smog on the city. After banning a majority of cars from the rode, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog(doc 2)."" Thats all it took, one day to make a difference, but most people of the world cannot fathom a day without their car. With the amount of people moving around this global beauty, smog covers the city, and yet nothing serious has been permanently done about it.

Bogata, Columbia has a special day every year: A car-free day created to promote the use of alternate transportation and reduce smog. Citizens and businessmen all support the cause, when one day made into "" A good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower pollution(Doc 3)."" Although one day isn't nearly long enough to undo the harm that cars have done to the world,  but at least it raises awareness that can spread even quicker, than a thickening smog, throughout the world.

The United States has demonstated the effects of their awareness of these problems. Evidence and researchers both notice and support that people are getting "" Fewer cars, Driving less, and getting fewer liscenses(doc 4)."" The decline can be tied to not being able to afford a car, but evidence refutes that by saying that it is a more fundamental revalation. People are starting to become aware of the endless benefits of a car-free world, but are stuck in this world which is consumed by them.

Stuck in this automobile-centered world, people cannot see nor fathom the idea of no automobiles, and believe it to be impractical and undesirable. But if the world were to alter itself, to better accomidate this lifestyle, cities would represent a whole new meaning, "" Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, comerical and public transportation traffic woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety(doc 4).""With some changes, people will soon see the world in a new light. One city, state, nation, and world at a time will make the change.

My fellow citizens, join me, in this revolution to evolve this incompatent world.

This is also beneficial because it allows me to learn about different cultures and their history.

Similarly, I have a strong interest in philosophy. I have studied philosophy for years and I am very knowledgeable about the different branches of philosophy. By understanding the different philosophies, I can better understand my own thoughts and how they might be viewed by others. This is important because it allows me to form my own opinions and to think about the different arguments that are being made about different subjects.

"There is no doubt that a degree certificate can reflect only one's academic achievements. However, it is important to remember that a degree certificate does not necessarily reflect all abilities essential for successful career. For example, a degree in engineering may be very valuable in certain fields, such as engineering consulting, but it may not be as valuable in other fields, such as marketing.

Therefore, it is important for young people to have a wide range of skills and abilities when looking for a career. A degree certificate can be a valuable indicator of academic achievement, but it is not the only indicator of a person's skills and abilities.

"I agree that the government should spend more money on medical care and education than on building theaters and sports stadiums. For one thing, medical care and education both have direct benefits for a larger number of people in society. Medical care ensures that people have access to quality healthcare, which can help to prevent or treat serious illnesses and diseases. Similarly, education provides people with the opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills that can be used to improve their lives. For example, it can open up job opportunities in the future, or help people become more informed citizens.

Furthermore, investing in medical care and education can have positive long-term impacts on society. Good healthcare can help reduce mortality rates and improve quality of life, while education can help to reduce poverty and inequality. In contrast, building theaters and sports stadiums generally only offer short-term benefits, such as providing entertainment for a limited period of time. Furthermore, a lot of public money is often wasted on these projects due to the large number of costs associated with them, such as construction and maintenance expenses.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters and sports stadiums. These investments have direct and long-term benefits for a larger number of people in society, whereas theaters and stadiums offer only short-term advantages and often involve a large amount of waste.

"The power of music is often underestimated. Many people underrate its ability to bring joy, create a certain atmosphere, and express emotion without the need for words. While many genres exist today, classical music has been around for centuries and remains one of the most popular forms around the world. Classical music has had an undeniable influence on modern-day compositions and continues to be appreciated by generations both past and present. Classical music is known as art or concert music because it was originally written with 'art' in mind rather than entertainment purposes. It typically features a larger ensemble than other types of popular music, including instruments such as violins, cellos, basses, harpsichords and more depending upon the composer's preference. This genre can also include solo piano pieces or those constructed from smaller string quartets or chamber orchestras which are composed for specific occasions – like weddings or parties – where a classical piece may set just the right mood needed for that special event. In addition to its aesthetic beauty when performed live at concerts or recorded on CD/digital formats, classic musical works have become increasingly valued over time due to their timelessness and enduring relevance across various cultures worldwide. Composers such as Johannes Brahms considered himself responsible not only for creating new compositions but also preserving traditional ones; he famously said “I don’t invent anything—I simply rewrite old things better” referring to his penchant for updating existing melodies using different harmonies while staying true to their original spirit and style throughout his works like Symphony No 3 in F major (1883). . This reverence towards ancient musical traditions is evident even today; recent decades have seen a large boom in popularity among young artists who experiment with mixing classical elements into contemporary styles while keeping symphonic structures intact despite any modifications made along the way - this fusion could be described as an example of how tradition influences innovation even within our own times!. Furthering this idea further we can see how

"Freedom to chose our leader is nothing more than an illusion. Voters have absolutely no saying in who shall take their place on the presidential seat. This is what the Electoral College does. It is an archaic system and unreliable system in which the whole of the presidential election is decided by the bias of the few whom are ""pledged"" to a certain party but at the end can choose whoever the like the most. This is not the Democracy we so dearly hold in our hearts like Americans and it goes well against the principles our forefathers taught us as free pople. Undeniably the Electoral College negates any concept of the democracy of America, making the impotance of the will of the people meaningless and nothing more than an illusion.

Deep into our history is the recaunting of how such a terrible system as the Electoral College came to be. It was originally a settlement on the dispute of how the president should be elected, either by the people or by Congress. Now the first option would have been the perfect one, but there are always those who would firts dei to loose their power to the pople of our country. And the clash of interest was so large it could have broken the nation in two as we have seen happened a few times in history. As such a great many years have passed since this whole argument and at every election poeple are realizing the faults of this flawed concept. At its core the system is Useless. It is the most antidemocratic idea ever to have been in practice and one that still is in use. It overpowers the will of millions with the will of a few hundred. That is why such a monster should be abolished.

The year is 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush clash for the seat in the white house. The election draws to an end and the votes are counted. There is a clear discrepancy in the votes, making Al Gore the winner, and by all means, the next president of the United States of America. But somewhere else there's also a clear discrepancy. Back at the Electoral College the counting says Bush won against Al Gore even though Al had already won the poeple of America. On that election 5 pople choose the fate of an entire nation. 5 people only. Such a thing is outrageous, and we are lucky it hasn't happened again nor more frequently. But thing is it shouldn't happen at all. That's ehy the POEPLE should choose insted of 538 what'stheirfaces. This endevour proves one thing and one thing only.

Unreliability. It is illogical that one wins the masses of the common citizens but looses because of five well dressed ones.

"There are a lot of advantages of limiting car usage. Yes a lot of people use cars to get around, but there are other ways to get around. Limiting car usage would probably cause a lot of complaints, but I think once people started limiting how much they drove everyday, they wouldn't see the need as much.

In Paris, for example, they have banned driving due to smog. The story ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Robert Duffer states that ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of the smog."" Only five days of banning drivers brought the smog rate down 60 percent, that's huge. To make it easier for the people of Paris to get around, they had public transit free of charge for those five days. If driving was banned for a while people would find other ways to get around, and other people in the community would help them, like the transit bus giving free rides those five days.

Some people may argue that it's a free country and we shouldn't be limited to how much we're allowed to drive our cars. Yes it's a free country but limiting car usage is actually getting people to be active, instead of being lazy and driving everywhere you go. The United States has the highest percentage of obesity. With limiting how much you can use your car it will make people walk places, if they really have to go somewhere. Also riding a bike, or even riding a bus or train. However, unlike your own car, to get to the bus stop or train station, it will take some walking, which is good.

Also another advantage of limiting car usage would be all the things that would be fixed around our community. With people walking more, the community and city people would want to make our area look better while we walk. In the story ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Andrew Selsky states, ""..Pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" With less driving and more walking to get to places, the community would fix our sidewalks and make more shopping centers and restaurants closer.

Limiting car usage will be hard to adjust to at first, but I think in the long run it's a winwin. It helps us get active and lower our stress from driving, and it helps our environment.",0,"tensor([[-0.0695, -0.3553, -0.2833,  ..., -0.3652,  0.3962, -0.0855],

He also told me how his brother and father died when he was six-eight, but he also told me how he came to America and how hard it was.

When my grandpa was born he was born poor. He had one brother a dad and a mom his dad did constructing and his mom most got everyone ready for school and tried to make everyone food. The closest school near my grandpa was 3.4miles away he had to go walking, but he went to anyway school he cared about his learning and he found it fun. It was a big deal to go to school where my grandpa lived or lived near by not many people get even get to go school at all it was that special.

My grandpa was only five when his father died his father was a man with a lot of problem. His father got him self into so much other people and gang. People looked for father but he kept low until one day he went to work and there were four people waiting for him he tried to run but he was to late because one of them shot him with gun they left him with three gun shot in his body laying on dirt he bleed out before the they could come and save him.

As for grandpa brother he got sick he said sick for two months my grandpa told me he was smart man he teach my grandpa how read and write better my grandpa said ""he the reason why he got such high grades in school"" when he got sick that when my grandpa tried to do everything for him so he can stay alive but back then medicine wasn't very good, and keep in mind we not in the u. s.a and it the year 1976 and if you did have that type of medicine it very expense. The most my grandpa and his mom can do is pray to god every night to get his blessing for his brother and his brother died in his sleep. They dug out a grave for him and everyone said there prayers his mother won't stop crying for one month but then she accept the fact he was dead.

When my grandpa got more older had two daughter and two son and he meant my grandma. He had to take the test to go to u. s.a. He told me it was hard because you had to learn a lot about u. s.a off of a notebook they give and out of that notebook they ask you 50 question out of the 200 question they could ask you, and it all random after he passed him he start to pack his back to America he said ""bye"" to my grandma his two daughter and two sons. When he was going to America he wanted to go to Virginia and he did he told me it was hard at first because he only know a little bit a of English he was looking for a job and he found one he worked at a restaurant and two other job once he start to make money he start to save it up to bring his daughters and sons and his wife he took him about 8 months he said to get all the money saved up.

"When your asking for advice it is good to get multiple opinions. Its is good because if you only ask one person they could tell you to do the wrong thing or something bad. Also if you only ask only one person they could be telling you to do something thats to nice. If you ask multiple people for their opinion and advice it gives you more variety of opinions so you can pick the best choice. It is always better to get multiple opinions when asking for advice.

Lets say you ask your a random person for advice and your mom and dad for advice. Your mom and dads advice will most likely be better than the strangers advice. The stranger doesnt know you and probably wont care what you do. Your mom and dads advice will be better because they know you and will probably want you to make the right choice. Thats why it is always better to get multiple opinions when asking for advice.

If you were in a store and people were stealing if you ask multiple people what to do their responses could be completely different. If you ask one person what to do they could say that you should join them a steal with them. If you ask a different person they could tell you to tell somebody that those people are stealing. Another person could say to just get out of there and get away from those people. So now that you have multiple peoples opinions now you can make the better choice. If you would have only asked the first person for their advice you might have went and stole with them because thats what they told you to do and you didnt ask any other people for their advice. Thats why it is always better to ask for multiple opinions when asking for advice.

Say you are at a party and people are doing drugs. If you ask a good friend what you should do if you are getting pear pressured to do drugs a good friends advice would be for you to say no and not to do the drugs. If you ask somebody else they might tell you to do it with them. If you didnt ask that good friend for their advice you could have done the drugs and gotten hurt. Thats why it is very important to get for multiple opinions when asking for advice so now you can make the right choice.

So whenever you are in a bad situation and you need advice make sure you always ask for multiple opinions. If you ask for multiple opinions you have a better chance of making the right choice. If you are asking strangers for advice ask at least five people they might just say something random because they dont know you. If you are asking family for advice you should ask at least two people because you still need to get multiple opinions but they care about you more that and stranger do so you dont need as many opinions. These are all reasons why when asking for advice it is better to ask for multiple different peoples opinions.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0588, -0.3361, -0.3954,  ..., -0.5737, -0.0260,  0.4655],

"Senator [Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am a resident and a student in our great state, writing to address an issue that has stirred intense debate over the years, the future of the Electoral College. On careful examination of the facts and arguments for both sides of the issue, I believe that while the Electoral College system has its shortcomings, it should be preserved and not replaced by the popular vote.

Firstly, the Electoral College, as per the federal register, was established as a compromise ensuring that both Congress and the public have a say in the election process. Yes, it isn't thoroughly democratic as the citizen's votes technically go to the electors, not directly impacting the presidential candidate's winning position (Posner). However, these electors are trusted members selected by the political parties, and it is a rarity that they betray their respective parties (Posner).

Secondly, Posner highlights that the winner of the Electoral College often ends up with larger numbers than they would have from a popular vote, due to the winner-take-all system. This system amplifies the winning candidate's victory and provides a distinct outcome. In situations where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College avoids the need and complication of run-off elections.

While it's worthwhile to take note of the criticism presented by Plumer, such as the electoral college being unfair to the voters in states where the candidates do not campaign, it is also important to consider that the Electoral College system requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Therefore, providing better representation of diverse interests across the nation (Posner). This representation allows for inclusivity from all regions, making the president everyone's president regardless of their geographical location.

However, the caveat of the current system makes it possible for a candidate to lose the presidency while winning the popular vote, as seen with Al Gore. And yes, the current system puts enormous weight on swing states, which can seem unfair to voters from safe states.

Despite these criticisms, I firmly believe the Electoral College should be preserved. Why? It provides certainty of outcome, mandates versatility in candidates, balances between regional and national interests, and saves us from potential electoral crises. Simply stitching to a popular vote might seem 'more democratic,' but could lead to its own host of problems and unintended consequences.

As a concerned citizen, I implore you to take these points into consideration as you join larger conversations about this issue. I believe retaining the Electoral College is crucial to ensuring fair elections in our country.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.4995, -0.1465, -0.7774,  ..., -0.1667,  0.1751,  0.6436],

"The significant role of the Internet in modern society has been undeniably evident. From its inception, the World Wide Web rapidly evolved and grew to become an integral part of our lives, providing a platform for communication, entertainment, commerce and much more. In fact, most people nowadays cannot imagine their lives without it. However, despite all its numerous advantages and benefits that have made it so indispensable in our everyday life, there are certain detrimental aspects associated with excessive use of the Internet as well. Although they may be overstated at times due to sensationalized media coverage or exaggerated claims by certain groups or individuals who oppose technology generally speaking, some risks do exist when too much time is spent online that should not be overlooked or underestimated. To begin with from a health perspective there is evidence suggesting people can suffer from physical problems such as neck pain or headaches resulting from long periods spent hunched over electronic devices looking at screens; furthermore research also suggests mental health issues like depression could result if one spends too much time on social media platforms mindlessly scrolling through posts or videos instead of engaging in face-to-face interactions which help keep us connected with friends and family prompting positive emotions hopefully alleviating loneliness often caused by spending long hours isolated indoors sat behind a desk glued to a laptop monitor for example. In addition to potential physiological side effects mentioned above another danger posed by being constantly connected stems from being exposed to inappropriate content more readily available than ever before ranging between violence depictions cyberbullying and pornography among other topics depending on one’s age bracket thus leaving children particularly vulnerable if adequate protective measures aren’t taken while using their digital devices resulting in negative influences leading them astray potentially corrupting their impressionable minds causing irreversible damage consequently greatly affecting normal development along with growth both emotionally as well as academically preventing them reaching full academic potential later down line upon entering college education system among other institutions without proper guidance provided beforehand now parents must stay vigilant by maintaining control whilst giving them access implementing strict rules

"I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly.

Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself.

it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong.

Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone.

I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up.

"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an interesting article that talks about the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a new technology that can identify human emotions. The author explains how this technology works by analyzing facial expressions and matching them to specific emotions. While this technology has many potential applications, one area where it could be particularly useful is in the classroom. In this essay, I will argue that using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The first reason why using FACS in the classroom is valuable is that it can help teachers understand how their students are feeling. This is important because students who are unhappy or stressed are less likely to learn effectively. By using FACS, teachers can quickly identify students who are struggling and provide them with the support they need. For example, if a student is feeling anxious about an upcoming test, the teacher can offer them extra help or reassurance.

The second reason why using FACS in the classroom is valuable is that it can help teachers create a positive learning environment. If a teacher knows that a particular activity or lesson is causing their students to feel bored or disengaged, they can adjust their teaching style to make it more engaging. This can lead to a more positive classroom atmosphere, where students are more motivated to learn and participate.

Finally, using FACS in the classroom can also help teachers identify patterns in their students' emotional states. For example, if a teacher notices that a particular student is consistently feeling stressed or unhappy, they can investigate further to find out why. This can help the teacher address any underlying issues that may be affecting the student's ability to learn.

In conclusion, using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can help teachers understand how their students are feeling, create a positive learning environment, and identify patterns in their students' emotional states. While there are certainly some concerns about privacy and data collection, these can be addressed by ensuring that the technology is used ethically and responsibly. Overall, I believe that FACS has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and learn, by giving teachers a powerful tool for understanding their students' emotional needs.",1,"tensor([[-0.2200, -0.2005, -0.4348,  ..., -0.4558, -0.3074,  0.7812],

Art, music, and drama classes are commonly offered in schools, but some people debate whether they should be electives or required for students of all ages. While these classes have the potential to spark creativity in some students, forcing students to take them can have unpleasant and even detrimental results. 

Forcing students to take classes in the Arts can be a challenging burden for those who struggle with creative expression or don’t have an interest in them. For instance, some students may become easily overwhelmed in an art class as they try to master the mechanics of painting, drawing, or sculpting. Similarly, music classes may feel intimidating if students feel like they are constantly being judged on their performance and can’t seem to get the rhythm or notes right. As for drama classes, the pressure of improvisation or memorizing lines in front of an audience can cause some students to dread the class. 

Allowing students to pick their own classes in the Arts makes more sense. That way, those with an interest or aptitude for a particular class can pursue it, while those who don’t have any inclination for the subject can find classes more suited to their interests. For example, if a student loves taking pictures, they may be more inclined to take a photography class than a painting class. 

Ultimately, mandating art, music, and drama classes can be difficult for some students and impractical for many. For this reason, it’s important to allow students to choose their classes, so they can pursue subjects and activities they find enjoyable and engaging. Doing so is beneficial for the students and the school in the long-run, as it increases the likelihood of students succeeding in their chosen electives, while also giving the school a better indication of student interests.",1,"tensor([[ 0.0795, -0.3253, -0.3213,  ..., -0.0899, -0.1059,  0.3750],

"Exploring another planet may be fun, but how would you like to live in a different planet? Venus is the second planet from the sun, but it's hard to study this mysterious planet because of the different risk that may be on the planet. Many people have tried to visit this planet but had no success. The reason of not accomplishing this goal is because of the many dangers that are within the planet. Although it may seem fun to go study another planet, some may consider it to be a major risk due to the fact that: It's a new planet with no knowlage of knowing what might happen, high or low tempretures, and challenges that may come to getting to know this planet.

Many scientist sent numerous spacecraft to Venus but unfortunetly none has maintaine to last the newly planet for more than a few hours. In the text it states, ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.2). However, people may ask why vist this planet, we have other planets that are more closer. Well studies have shown that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text it states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.4). So, the only difference of the Earth, and Venus is the tempreture they have.

In any planet, you don't happen to know the tempretures in the planet. Many plantes have high or low tempretures, and some may even have toxic air for us humans. In Venus the air is mostly made up of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid. In the text it states, ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and ""Clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in Venus's atmosphere""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Wanting to go vistit another planet is meaning having to wear special gear so you dont get sick due to the different air it has from Earth. Furthermore, the text also states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Having high degrees is very dangerous for us humans, especially if we've never encountered this problem here on Earth.

Austrounots are very brave people, they do all these studies for us so we could understan how another planet functions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) do send humans (Austrounots) to go study Venus, but they don't particuarly land on the planet. In the text it states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostlie condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This motion is leting the humans hover over the planet and it helps protect the people from any harmful ground conditions by not touching the planets surface.

In conclusion, it is fun to study another planet, yes it may seem harmful but in reality the NASA people do know what they are doing and yes they will watch over you and protect you. They",0,"tensor([[-0.7096, -0.2062, -0.0355,  ..., -0.2830,  0.9462,  0.3518],

"Greenhouse gases, smog, pollution, and traffic jams. What do all of these have in common? They all come from vehicles. In many countries, they're changing that. Countries such as Colombia, France, Germany, and even America are limiting car usage. The affects of these countries going nearly car-free are quite helpful and convienient. Some of the advantages of this are that citizens get more exercise, less polution as well as less gasoline used, and traffic jams are prevented.

Exercise, being one of the factors that's lacking when people drive everywhere, can be changed just by simply choosing to walk, run, bike, skate, etc. instead. That's just what many people are doing. Vauban, Germany has a new approach for transportation. Rather than driving to stores along highways that are quite distant from neighborhoods, stores are placed closer on a main street that's within walking distance. Also in Colombia, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city""(Andrew Selsky, paragraph 28).

Pollution is one of the biggest problems on Earth thanks to cars. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced so that every other day either even or odd-numbered license plates would not be permitted to leave home with their cars. While in Bogota, Colombia, for a few years there's been a day without them completely. Other than buses and taxis of course. This annual day ""has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths""(Andrew Selsky), which helps with the exercise factor as well as lessoning the pollution and traffic jams due to driving. Americans have also been saving money by not even buying a car to begin with. The number of people with liscenses and cars has definetly dropped over the years.

From getting more exercise to reducing pollution, going without a car definetly has it's advantages. Thanks to bills, bans, and laws, the dependency of the car has gone down as well. So, will Earth one day be car-free?",0,"tensor([[-0.1827, -0.1958,  0.0199,  ..., -0.3703,  0.8198,  0.2854],

"Yes I am for technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

The reasonn why I said yes is because. Kids have changed, we dont like certain stuff, teachers think the kids are feeling good in class but on the inside could be the Devil and God fighting. The world is changing the future of America, and the schools should do something about it.

(Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.) ''From the article''.

Us kids sit in a building for 7 hours and 30 minutes. There is no excuse for a kid to feel like he is forced to come to school. School should feel like home, it should be a place to go to get away from bad things in your life. Me personally, I dislike school, yeah we learn the material but not everybody learns the material. Some people come here just so they have food in their stomachs. Some kids come here for relationships. Some kids come to school for fun. Thats wrong. Kids should come to learn. Learn different ways learn life materials, learn how to work with people, learn how to be great citizens.

(''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson like a effective human instuctor.) (From the Article).

I love my education . But I love my country more. The way I look at school is disgusting a descrace. The people that gave this stupid test. Should get fired. Istep shouldn't determine if I graduate. It shouldnt detemine if im smart or not. it shouldnt be based on a national level. It should be a state thing. You know why? Let me tell you why. The stuff i learn in Geometry and in English. Are not on ISTEP. This test is basically a test that we dont study for, and it really does suck that this test determines if I graduate. Its unfair.

Hopefully you take what I said to the heart and look at what America is in 5 to 10 years. Because this technology would change everything. Teachers would understand there students more.

"I believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are a few reasons for this. First, advertisements often use exaggerated or unrealistic images to sell their products. This can make it difficult to compare products objectively. Second, advertisements often focus on the features and benefits of the product rather than the cost. This can make it difficult to compare products based on price. Finally, advertisements often gloss over or ignore important details about the product. This can make it difficult to know whether the product is really worth buying.

All of these factors can make it difficult to compare products objectively. For example, if I am looking to buy a new laptop, I might be discouraged from buying a different laptop if the advertisements for that laptop focus on the features that that laptop has rather than the price. Similarly, if I am looking to buy a car, I might be discouraged from buying a car if the advertisements focus on the features that the car has rather than the price.

Overall, I believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This can make it difficult to make informed decisions about what product to buy.

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This idea is exemplified in the German suburb, Vauban, where residents have given up their cars in favor of alternative means of transportation. This movement towards ""smart planning"" is gaining traction in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world. By limiting car usage, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate congestion, and promote healthier, more connected neighborhoods.

One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12% and some areas in the United States attributing up to 50%. By moving away from a car-centric lifestyle, communities can drastically reduce their impact on the environment. The German suburb of Vauban, for example, has seen a significant decrease in car ownership, with 70% of families not owning a car at all. This shift towards alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, can help combat climate change and improve air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in congestion. Car-dependent suburbs often suffer from traffic jams and overcrowded roads, leading to increased commute times and frustration for residents. By adopting a more compact and accessible approach to suburban planning, communities can create infrastructure that prioritizes walking, biking, and public transportation. This not only reduces congestion but also makes neighborhoods more livable and people-friendly. Vauban, for instance, has placed stores within walking distance of residential areas, encouraging a sense of community and making daily errands more convenient.

In addition to reducing emissions and congestion, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on health and well-being. Increased reliance on walking and biking promotes physical activity, leading to a healthier population. The absence of cars in Vauban has created a peaceful and calm environment, where the sounds of bicycles and conversation replace the noise of traffic. Residents often cite increased happiness and reduced stress as major benefits of living car-free.

While the transition to limiting car usage may present challenges, such as a loss of revenue for delivery companies, the long-term benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Government initiatives, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's promotion of ""car reduced"" communities in the United States, are supporting this movement. As more communities adopt alternative transportation methods and create infrastructure that facilitates car-free living, the demand for cars may decrease, resulting in a cultural shift away from car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating congestion, and promoting healthier neighborhoods, communities can create more sustainable and livable environments. The German suburb of Vauban exemplifies this movement towards ""smart planning,"" where the majority of families do not own cars, and daily life revolves around walking, biking, and public transportation. As more communities around the world adopt similar approaches, the benefits of limiting car usage will become increasingly apparent.",1,"tensor([[-0.5527, -0.1994, -0.3667,  ..., -0.1278,  0.2753, -0.2805],

"Dear Florida Senator, There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now. They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.

To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not. As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"". In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all. Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for. The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what. The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the rodney and Obama election is mentioned. It brings up the fact that rodney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote. He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes. Those who opposed rodney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for rodney. If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.

In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. The slate of electors is not picked by the people. It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors. That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not. For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen. A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now. This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes. You can see that the current system has its flaws.

Many people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes. For example, in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes. This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes. The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.

In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote. Above all, it is more fair to the people. Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now. People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for. Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College. I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College. All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.",0,"tensor([[-0.8885, -0.6348, -0.4644,  ..., -0.2870,  0.5454,  0.4222],

Committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and drawbacks. On the positive side, an early commitment can help to focus your education and give you an impetus to work hard towards your chosen goal. Young people tend to be particularly energetic and motivated and so can focus on their career ambitions early on. However, committing to a career too early can be detrimental to personal growth. You may miss out on trying new activities and exploring different paths. Furthermore, you may change your mind as you get older and find it harder to adjust to a different career. Therefore, committing to a career at a young age can be a substantial decision and it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons.",1,"tensor([[ 0.2305, -0.1752, -0.5275,  ..., -0.4554,  0.0502,  0.3173],

The potential addition of an extra hour and thirty minutes to school each day for students could have a significant impact on their lives. For example, it is possible that student performance could improve if they are given extra time to focus on studies or better understand the material. Additionally, this increase in time may limit the amount of time available for family and peer relationships due to the addition of more school hours. Furthermore, local school districts could be faced with strain due to the heightened burden of providing teachers, resources, and updating curriculum to accommodate the addition. In conclusion, the implications of adding extra time to the school day should be carefully considered before any additional hours are added.",1,"tensor([[-0.1569, -0.3912, -0.3794,  ..., -0.2199,  0.1254,  0.2496],

"In the following ideas and information passage set we see the effects of using cars too much and how limiting our car use can have a huge impact on, not only our environment, but also on cities on people. Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?

In the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is ""After days of nearrecord pollution.."", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the ""City of Love"", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!

Like David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car.."". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.

Even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0471,  0.0612,  0.0669,  ..., -0.4486,  0.8622, -0.1016],

"When it comes to asking for advice, having more than one opinion is always helpful because, everyone is different and unique, not everyone has your best interest in mind, and because its an opportunity to hear new ideas that you might not have thought of before.

To start off, having multiple opinions is always good because society is so diverse nowadays, meaning that everyone is different. For example, some people are more knowledgeable in certain fields than others might be. If you were to ask a dietitian what you could do to lose weight, they'd more than likely know more about the topic than the sibling of your childhood friend.

Similarly, everyone has had different experiences in life. You wouldn't be able to ask a child what paying taxes is like, or, for that matter, what it feels like to purchase your first house. This is because they haven't had the same experiences as an adult might.

Another thing to take into consideration is that everyone has different views on life, because, as stated, society is so diverse now, everyone comes from a different religion, or has had different upbringings, thus, they have different opinions. This is a good thing because if everyone all had the same opinions and views on life, asking for advice would be pointless to begin with as you'd get the same answer over and over again.

Secondly, not everyone has your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, not everyone is a good influence. If you were to ask someone for advice on how to quit smoking, maybe asking an addict isn't the best idea, instead, you should go to someone who has fully recovered, as they'd better influence you.

Something else you should keep in mind is jealousy. Jealousy can persuade people into saying some nasty things that they may not exactly mean. You shouldn't ever let anyone else put you down for something that you feel is right.

Although there is a lot of good in the world, there will always be some people who want you to fail in life. It's important to not let hurtful opinions get to you, and its best to listen to the ones who are helping you strive for success. Learning to let go of toxic relationships is a good skill to learn, and one you should hold onto for a lifetime.

Another thing you should consider is that multiple opinions means more ideas! When you put two heads together, you can come up with more ideas than just one would be able to. Something that comes with more ideas are more things to consider, and more things to consider means you have that many more opportunities to find the best option for you.

Finally, an important thing to consider is that asking multiple people for advice can teach you how to ask for help, and how to accept the opinions of others and learn from it. Knowing how to ask for help is important, as not everyone can do everything all by themselves.

To sum it up, seeking multiple opinions is important when asking for advice because everyone is different, not everyone is a good influence, and because it means you get to hear new ideas.",0,"tensor([[ 4.1024e-01, -2.9190e-01, -3.8505e-01,  ...,  3.1040e-01,

"I think the use of techology than can read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is valuable. Technology would be able to make see and predict more student's emotions. Knowing the emotions of students would allow changes to be made in the teaching of individual students. With technology, classrooms would be more effiecient, have better test scores and grades and would allow for a better development in education.

Using technology would help teachers see what method of teaching would be best for their classroom, based on feedback given from technology. If teachers would use technology in the classroom, they could make changes in the way they teach their students, allowing better efficiency in the classroom. With better efficiency less time could be spent learning and more strengthening of what students know.

Technology would also help classrooms have better grades and do better on tests. This would be possible by seeing the students that are bored or confused. With students that are learning better and understanding more, their grades are sure to increase, as well as their test scores.

Technology would also help better develop education. With feedback from technology and a change in teaching styles, education as a whole could be changed. The change would consist of a better ability to teach students in the time they get with the teacher. And a better understanding in students of what they learned.

Technology to read emotional expressions in classrooms would be valuable. Classrooms would have better grades and test scores, be more efficient and allow for a development in education.

"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoral college and just leave up to popular vote. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution.

The electoral college is unfair because it takes away the democratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. In the United States of America we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesn get to run the country because the electoral college decided differently then we should not be called a democracy. For example in the 2000 election with Al Gore and Gorge W. Bush, the people of the united states voted for Al Gore, but due to the electoral college Bush won the election. in the passage The Indefensible Electoral College it says ""Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the USA would prefer a people vote instead of both!

furthermore, I believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the USA. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other opponent wins then where is the democracy in that? also in the article The Indefensible Electoral College says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. Luckily, vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesn notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same candidate so that will be an easy state to win for that candidate. The electoral college is nothing but problems.

"Many people from around the glode rely on their cars to get from place to place. Not driving cars have many disadvantages but they also can have many advantages too. limiting car usage can do much good to you and your community.

the passage ''In German Suburb, life goes on Without Cars'' In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. a souce says ''when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way.'' One of the advantages of not owning a car in this community was the feeling of a more compact and accessiable way to public transportation. By not having cars if you were to walk down the street instead of hearing car motars distantly running, sources say they hear the sound of bikes and adults and even childrens chatter filling their ears. With not having cars it can make it so much easier to get social and connect with others in your area instead of being a hermit you can meet new people, make friends and even create plans which is a major benifit.

In ''Paris bands driving due to smog,'' Paris,Frace also had the same idea to get rid of cars to clear the air of their global city. This can help with allergies and getting sick which als can cause some to become less social towards others. This largely well know city's expectations where correct. Congestion went down 60% clearing the air for a better enviroment for residents. With the city having a lower air pollution and smog reduced, a benifit of not having a car is free public trasportation Monday-Friday. This saves tons of money that you could have used to pay for gas,car insurance,and any costly repairs or damage you might need to fund for.

The city Bogota, located in Columbia as well limited the usage of cars .In ''Car free Day is Spinning into a big hit in Bogota,'' Instead people biked,hiked,skated which makes you become more active,and residents took public buses as well; promoting alternitive transportation. This of course helped to reduce the smog and lowered the air pollution. Not having to worry about a car is also a benefit in which it reduces stress .Limiting car usage also cuts traffic making it quicker to get to your designated location safer which is more benificial.

The end of car culture also benifits implications for carbon emissions, again helping our living space. People feel more connceted with out driving to meet up with a group of friends because of the internet. saving time for the long boring drive,concerving resources, lowering emissions and improving safety are all so important to us now and later down the road if we limit our usage of cars.

Overall the advantages for limiting car usage are sky high and bring much good to our enviroment , community and personal health emotionally and physically along with finance too. This helps future generations also. The best thing to do is limit the use of cars for a happy and healthy lifestyle.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0433, -0.0910,  0.4541,  ..., -0.3662,  0.7913, -0.0827],

"The internet has brought about a revolution in the field of information and communication, and it's impact on our lives is undeniable. It has transformed the way we obtain and share information, and has made it more accessible to individuals all over the world. However, the question remains whether it will ever replace books and the written word as the primary source of information. In my opinion, while the internet has it's benefits, it is unlikely to replace books and the written word entirely.

Firstly, books have been around for centuries and have served as an essential source of information and knowledge for people. They are tangible and can be easily accessed without the need for electricity or an internet connection. Moreover, books provide a more immersive reading experience than the internet, as they allow individuals to engage with the material in a dedicated manner without any distractions.

Secondly, the internet has an overwhelming amount of information available, making it difficult to distinguish reliable sources of information from unreliable ones. In contrast, books have gone through a more rigorous publishing process and have undergone editorial scrutiny before being released to the public. This means that books are often more trustworthy sources of information than the internet.

Lastly, the act of reading a book is a more active and engaging experience than passively scrolling through web pages. When we read a book, we are forced to focus our attention and actively engage with the material. This results in better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

However, this is not to say that the internet is without it's advantages. It is a highly efficient and convenient way to access information quickly, and it allows for a vast range of information to be available to individuals all over the world.

In conclusion, while the internet has undoubtedly transformed the way we obtain and share information, it is unlikely to replace books and the written word entirely. Books have been around for centuries and have served as a trusted source of information for people. Moreover, the act of reading a book provides a more immersive and engaging experience than the internet. However, the internet has it's advantages and is a highly efficient and convenient way to access information quickly. Ultimately, both books and the internet have their merits, and both will continue to coexist as crucial sources of information for individuals.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as promote healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. This essay will explore these advantages in more detail.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage set, passenger cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, after power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health. In the example of Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents report being happier and less tense without the need to rely on cars for transportation. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to overall well-being and improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, such as walking or cycling. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. This event aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By encouraging active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, individuals can improve their physical fitness and reduce the risk of health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable communities. The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" describes how the community of Vauban in Germany is an example of ""smart planning"" to separate suburban life from car use. This concept is being adopted globally to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. By placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation, communities can reduce the need for cars, decrease traffic congestion, and create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in various contexts. To achieve these advantages, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, and to plan communities that support these options.",1,"tensor([[-0.1509, -0.2826, -0.5321,  ..., -0.4221,  0.4756, -0.3248],

"""Yes I agree that it would be amazing to have life on Mars, but theres just simply no evidence to support your claim."" I argue. Most people think there is life on Mars but I disagree. I think this because, there is no evidence, there are things on Earth that look like faces but are not, and we have digitaly made the picture 3 times bigger and found nothing.

First of all I think this because, there is no evidence. No evidence has been found to suggust that there were aliens who built the face. The only thing you can find on aliens are in newspapers or on tv and they are based on pure opions instead of facts.

Secondly I think this because there are things on earth that may look like a face but isnt one. There are many landforms that may resembel a face but were proven to be naturaly formed.

Lastly, I think this because we have digitaly made the image 3 times bigger and found no objects in the picture. So if there were objects in the picture we would have been able to see them. This supports the idea that ther is no life on Mars to create the face.

This all supports the idea that aliens did not create the face on Mars. I belive that the face was created by natural elements and just happens to look like a face.",0,"tensor([[-4.0157e-01, -4.2358e-02,  7.2869e-02,  ..., -5.3863e-01,

"Giving back to one's community is an important part of being a productive member of society. It is a way of showing that we care about the place where we live and the people who live there with us. Unfortunately, many young people today do not seem to value community service as much as they should.

There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. First of all, young people are often very busy with school, work, and other commitments. They may not have a lot of free time to dedicate to volunteer work. Additionally, young people may not be aware of the many ways in which they can help their communities. They may not know where to start or what kinds of activities would be most helpful. Finally, some young people may simply be selfish and uninterested in giving back to their communities.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is important for young people to try to find ways to give back to their communities. There are many ways to do this, and even a small amount of time or effort can make a big difference. For example, young people can volunteer at local schools, hospitals, or community centers. They can help with fundraising or awareness campaigns for important causes. They can also simply be good neighbors by helping with yard work, shoveling snow, or running errands for elderly or disabled people.

Giving back to one's community is important for many reasons. It helps to make our communities better places to live, and it also sets a good example for others. Young people who take the time to help their communities can make a real difference.

"E-Sports are becoming increasingly popular in the modern world. It is gaining traction as a legitimate form of competition, and is even being featured on some college campuses. While there has been a lot of discussion about whether E-Sports should be considered an official sport or not, one thing is clear: it has become a phenomenon with its own unique culture. The term 'E-Sport' encompasses any video game that can be played competitively online or in person at tournaments. The most well known examples would include games like League of Legends, Overwatch and Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO). These games often have millions of viewers tuning in to watch professional players compete against each other for prize money or prestige within their respective communities. As such, many companies are beginning to invest heavily into these events by providing sponsorships and hosting tournaments around the world. At first glance, it might seem difficult to understand why people would devote so much time and energy towards watching this type of activity when conventional sports already exist. However, there are a few key aspects that set E-Sports apart from traditional physical sports which make them stand out for many reasons – most notably their accessibility and level playing field regardless of age or gender identity/expression. Unlike traditional sports where certain physical attributes can give individuals an advantage over others (such as height in basketball), the virtual nature of E-sports allows anyone to compete on equal terms no matter what card they were dealt with in life - something that makes it particularly attractive for young people who may struggle to play more demanding physical activities due to underlying health problems or disabilities which prevent them from doing so safely/effectively . This makes for an exciting environment where anything could happen!. Holding competitions also provides financial incentives for those whose talents lie within gaming; professional gamers often earn salaries comparable to athletes from major team sports leagues such as NBA & NFL through tournament winnings plus sponsorship deals. This helps bridge the gap between elite eSports teams & amateur

Attending regular classes can have many advantages over solely attending online classes, particularly when it comes to learning from other cultures, gaining confidence in interactions with people, and getting involved in activities. Through taking regular classes, students can have the opportunity to interact with other students and professors from a variety of cultures, giving them the opportunity to learn and build their understanding of different people and their respective cultures. Furthermore, regular classes have an emphasis on student participation and engagement which can help to build a confident attitude when it comes to both public speaking and working with peers on tasks, helping students to become more confident in their interpersonal skills. Finally, with regular classes, there are more opportunities for extracurricular activities that can help to build connections with other students, as well as valuable skills such as creative thinking, teamwork, and leadership.",1,"tensor([[-0.0137, -0.2831, -0.1520,  ..., -0.1932,  0.1624,  0.2009],

"The Face on Mars has many conspiracies, but believing it was created by aliens is ridiculous. There is no proven fact or discovery that aliens exist. I would have to disagree with that, and just believe it is a natural landform. There has many research done and work to figure out what the Face on Mars is, and saying it was created by aliens puts that hard work to shame.

The Face on Mars is a qustionable conspiracy. However, I believe The Face on Mars is a natural landform because we have no evidence of alien lifeform. In the article it states, ""MichaelMalin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thosands of anxious web surfers waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform"". Based on this evidence I can state their was no sight of any aliens. I believe there are other natural reasons as to why their is an object that looks like a face on Mars. Pictures were taken as well to show proof that their isn't any alien lifeform on Mars. It also states in the article that the Face on Mars is more equivalent to a butte or a mesa which are natural landforms. Although people may have wondered if there was lifeform on Mars, technology wasn't as advanced back then. As years went on, technology became greater, and we were able to use that technolgy to see if there was signs of life.

In conclusion, I believe aliens did not create the Face on Mars. I believe this because there is not any proof or reseach to show that aliens do exist. The face on Mars is just a natural landform, and there has work done for many years to show it.",0,"tensor([[-7.6854e-01,  2.8715e-02, -4.0391e-01,  ..., -1.7069e-01,

"Dear,

State senator, i believe that we should keep the electoral college because it it not only benifits congress it aso benifits the president who is running to be our leader as well and also our electors.

The electoral college has been made from our founding fathers in the constitution it shows a meaning, a meaning not only to us but also to The United states and in the most part its total strangers who pick these people its a political party  it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes and so does the president just like it may be in the other side of the green grass as well.

""The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast""(pg22).

In each state the cadinate that is running for that paticular has their own group of electors that in safe hands its a great thing to know that people that are being chosen are being reviewed by state laws as well to be exact and either way we help choose our state electors its not about the specific people its about all of us and how we contributre to the votes to our candinates in the electoral college we are not only helping the electors the electors are helping the presidnt as well and most of all we are helping United State Of America Founding Fathers.",0,"tensor([[-0.1491, -0.0058,  0.2231,  ..., -0.7988,  0.7087,  0.5379],

"According to Phones and Driving from the following prompt it asks the question should phones be used during travel, or should not. Throughout the recent years and the invention of ""the smartphone people"" utilized the technology to keep in contact with family and other people around the world.

This could have been easily avoided if the driver took her eyes off the phones for at least 5 more seconds before impacting the car. Texting and Driving can easily land anyone in prison or cause them to receive serious injuries from not looking at the road and driving properly. Local PD and others would sincerely advice any driver to put their phone on silent to avoid severe casualties and to keep others safe while on the road

"To begin with, I think we should keep Electoral Colleges because there are many benefits. A Electoral College is a process not a place in wich the founding fathers established to compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and eleciton of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Some of the many benefits are a voiding run-off elections, it helps citizens votes be more meaningfull.

For starters, Electoral Colleges help avoid run-off elections. The benefit of having it avoid run-off elections is, that when there is a run-off election and when no canidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is greatly reduced because of the electoral colleges. As a example, as a example you only have 43 percent majority of the popluarity votes. If more votes in the college is elected to one president than the other the president is alot more likely to win.

In addition, another reason on why we should keep Electoral Colleges are because it helps citizens votes seem more meaningfull. How a Electoral College does this is by, making you vote more powerful. If we didnt have these colleges democrats in Texas, and Republicans in California would know there vote wouldnt mean anything therefore they would not pay much attention to the election than if they knew the president was picked by populat votes. That is why in 2012 only half of the eligable voters voted because they knew that there vote would not make a difference.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should keep our Electoral Colleges, because is helps by avoiding run-off elections, and it helps citizens votes more meaningfull and has more power to know that popularity votes now count because of the Electoral Colleges and more elegible can now vote with confidence.",0,"tensor([[-0.3305,  0.0052, -0.4987,  ..., -0.3097,  0.7723,  0.3084],

"In the articles ""making lisa Smile,"" The author describe how new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can indetify Human emtions. people should not creat a System that can indentify people emtion because it's destroy people privicy.

To creat a Machine that can identify their emtion and action can be danger. because it's like taking their privicy away, also people would not feel said because they machine can indentify their emtion and their action. I don't think it's a effective thing to creat because many people will felt that their bein watch. to creat a Machine that can indentify people emtion and action is like taking their freedom form them. Also people can take advantage of this and invade other people privice.

This system can invade people privice and they won't fet safe. as it's show in the articles using video can track theri facial movemets in real face or in the painted face. Also it can identify their weight. Although this is a great invition thing for human It's still not efficted. because to able to figure people emotion and action it's not our problem. because it's like when your sibling go through your stuff that is privice. to able to figur out people privice can also destroy realtionship, because everbody has dark secerty.

In now day technology is develope more and more, somtime they can be usefull. Most of they time they can invade people privice and realtionship. It's not neccery to identiy people emtion because it's could be a private, or famiy problem.

to identify privice it's taking their right and freedom also people might not felt safe because they know bein spy. through out the invition this facial Action Coding is not most efficted invition. because they are usefull but in the other hand it's ruind people privice.

Although this Facial Action Coding system might be usefull for some people. I still don't think it's exclussice invition because this invition can destroy or take away people freedom. most people might not felt safe by their surrounding because they are bein watch. This Facial Action Coding System invition should not be well reconzied because it's can intamated other people relationship like family problem also it can deterimed their facial expressions, and can also reveal their emtion; Most people might felt that they are taking their privice and freedom form them.",0,"tensor([[-0.1413, -0.1262,  0.5593,  ..., -0.6298,  0.7515, -0.1503],

"When making decisions people often look to others for advice. Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand. By asking more than one person you get multiple sides of your situation, their past experience in doing something similar, and in the end you will be more confident in your final choice.

Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision.

Some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. This would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible.

After asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.

An example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for their opinion on a problem is very beneficial. By asking more people you can see all different sides of the question. These people have different experiences which could cause them to see things that you cant. Having all of these different sides should make it so your final decision is something you can be happy and confident with.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1726, -0.4050, -0.4563,  ..., -0.3601,  0.5064,  0.2004],

"I feel the elctoral college is overpowered and isnt neccsary

Ifeel that the Electoral college is not a place its a process. The Founding fathers established it in the constitutional as a compromise between the election pf president by vote. See the elctoral college consists of 538 elctors. A majority of 270 elctoral votes is required.

To Begin,Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. these electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political, but as usaul state laws vary on how elcetors sare selected and what thier responsibilities are....

See the presidential election is held every four years on the tueday after novemvber, but what people dont know when you vote for canidates you are actually voting for your canidate's elcetors.

Most feel its ""winner takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate; but it's states like Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proprtional representation."" After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""  listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors

Under the electoral college system voters not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. the pickers of first place depends on the state, maybe even state conventions, all these things can help inprove the voting polls and make them quicker",0,"tensor([[-0.4330, -0.2085,  0.2251,  ..., -0.3259,  0.8007,  0.5642],

It can be incredibly difficult to maintain your own individuality in a world that is so highly influenced by the opinions of other people. Social media, peer groups, and societal expectations can all be sources of stress and pressure that can cause us to forget or ignore the things that make us unique. It's important to recognize the importance of staying true to who we are, even if that means going against what others think.

We all have unique traits and characteristics that make us special. Whether it is our interests, our passions, or our beliefs, these things make us unique and only serve to enrich and enhance our lives.  So it's important to stay true to who we are, no matter what those around us may be saying. We should never be afraid to step out of our comfort zone and express our true selves, without fearing the judgement of others. 

No matter what the circumstances, we should never be scared to stand up for ourselves and be our own person. It can be especially empowering to take ownership of who you are and to be proud of the individual you have become. When we're able to stay true to ourselves, we become more resilient and self-assured.

At the end of the day, maintaining our individuality in a world so highly influenced by others’ opinions is an challenge. But if we can stay true to who we are and never forget the qualities that make us unique, it can make us more confident and remind us of our potential and strengths.",1,"tensor([[ 0.4137, -0.3214, -0.1826,  ..., -0.4444,  0.0163,  0.3053],

"Dear Senator,

We should be changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should just vote for the vice president and the president. People are voting for the Electoral college while they should be voting to see who will be their new president. The electoral college is getting more votes than the president should be getting. Insead of having to have about 270 eletoral votes they should just see which president gets the most votes.

Therfore, the eletoral college mut be stopped and we shall just vote for the presient and vice president. The president should be able to be president for 5 years if they reach a good amount of votes. With eletoral college its sometimes hard to chose the president because they are getting tied with the eletoral votes. I say that the president and the electers should be the ones to pick the vice president. The vice president shall approve of the president also.

Also if someone is running for president and the other person wins they shouldn't be upset because they still will get another chance. One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate. To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. Bigger states are getting more attention the all other states. Some states are not getting any votes at all. Also candidates are getting the same amount of votes, but differnent amount of electoral vote. They want to see who gets the most votes to be the president the most electoral votes. People vote so they can have a perference.

In conclusion, we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The president should be easier to chose and should be chosen equally and fairly.",0,"tensor([[-0.2294, -0.3901,  0.2494,  ..., -0.6895,  0.8942,  0.5307],

"Dear State Senator,

I am arguing in favor of changing the electorol college to election by popular vote for the preesident of the united states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have know. Basically, in this process, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public offifce. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number. It is highly unlikely but one day if we dont change this, it will happen. in 1960, Hawaii sent two electors to congress, it could of ended in a disaster, luckily vice president Richard Nixon validated only his opponents electors. If their ever happened to be a tie, each state would only cast one vote, so it is not fair that say Wyoming would get as much as California which has seven times the amount of voters Wyoming has.

The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. Candidates dont spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the campaign in 2000, 17 states didnt see the candidates at all, and voters didnt get to see a campaign ad. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly without much basis in reality.

"The Face is just a natural landform. As the old photographs of it might have looked like as if it was made by aliens. The new photograph of the Face just shows a regular landform due to the higher resolution. The media is just trying to make you believe that it is an alien monument. At that time, they didn't' really what know what it was exactly. I am here to prove you that the Face is just a natural landform.

If the Face is an alien monument, there could have been mysterious looking structures on the monument. The Face is just a butte or a mesa as it was said by scientist Garvin that it reminded him of a butte in Idaho. The 2001 image of the Face doesn't show anything phenomonal, it is just a simple landform. According to NASA, the shadows just give the landform a face. As for my last evidence, Michael Malin and his team took a sharp photo of the Face explicitly revealing that it is just a landform.

As the old photographs suggests that it is something made by the aliens, it is not. It is just a landform based on the newer photograph. A scientist claimed that the Face is either a mesa or a butte which reminded him of a butte he saw before. As it is popular within the media, no one knows what it is. Later on, a group of scientists took a sharper photograph of the Face and confirmed that it is just a landform.",0,"tensor([[-5.4581e-01, -4.2462e-01, -1.7004e-01,  ..., -7.0272e-02,

"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because considering different perspectives allows for more informed decision making. Getting advice from more than one person provides a broader range of viewpoints and expertise on any given issue. Each person may have a unique insight or piece of wisdom to share based on their own background and experiences. By hearing multiple sides of a story or multiple potential options, a person asking for advice has more information to weigh the pros and cons of each choice. They can compare and synthesize the different opinions to gain a more holistic understanding of their situation and decision. 

An example of how seeking various opinions helped lead to a better outcome occurred when a friend of mine was deciding whether to accept a new job offer or stay in their current role. They consulted with not only their parents and spouse, but also their manager, coworkers, and friends who had recently changed jobs themselves. This allowed them to get input from those who knew their abilities and work history as well as those familiar with the different companies and responsibilities of each position. Incorporating perspectives from both their personal and professional networks helped them carefully consider factors like growth opportunities, work-life balance, and company stability that any single person may not have brought up. After weighing all the advice, my friend felt confident that they had made the choice that was best for their long-term career goals and needs.

In summary, getting multiple opinions provides a decision-maker with well-rounded guidance by exposing them to new ideas and mitigating individual biases. It enables a more informed final choice that takes numerous relevant viewpoints into account rather than relying on the perspective of just one or two advisors. While a single person's advice can certainly help, the complexity of most significant decisions warrants seeking opinions from various trusted sources.",1,"tensor([[-0.1066, -0.5062, -0.7521,  ..., -0.0921, -0.3166,  0.4021],

"Phones, iPhones, Androids, so many different devices to be distracted by. We seen a huge jump in vehicle accidents due to our technological advances in cars and phones. Today's world is such a dangerous place, especially on the roads. People have to be one hundred percent focused on the road to avoid accidents, sadly people have ignored the clear warning signs.

More than 1,500 people have died in car accidents in Georgia in 2016 alone. Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have increased in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past few years.

These deaths jumped by a third from 2014 to 2016 in Georgia.

As more people do it they become comfortable and trusting in the car, but sadly it's more than that. People are also addicted to phones, social media, and the constant search of ""making it"". They are yet to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Operating a mobile device should not be allowed.

Phones are the main thing today that are causing problems in our society. They distract and hook people in. It has a great purpose but used improperly by most of us. As many studies show, we ARE distracted by them and should be prohibited to use while operating a vehicle. AT&T mademany advertisements that said ""It can wait"" referring to the use of phones.

Winston Churchill's quote ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts"" is one of the most inspiring quotes of the modern era. On one hand, Churchill's quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. This encourages individuals to strive for continuous improvement and progress in their lives. On the other hand, Churchill's quote isn't complete without addressing failure. To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. 

I relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift. However, I used Churchill's words as a source of hope and motivation; regardless of my failures, I had the courage to push on and eventually graduate with much success. This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. 

Ultimately, Churchill's quote is a potent reminder that it is never too late to start again and to continue striving for excellence no matter the setbacks encountered. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals.",1,"tensor([[-6.5873e-01,  3.0017e-01, -1.1126e+00,  ..., -2.4136e-02,

"School bullying is a serious issue that has become increasingly widespread in today's society. It can affect any child, regardless of gender, age or socio-economic status. Bullying ranges from physical acts such as hitting and pushing to verbal threats and insults. School bullying can be particularly damaging since it not only affects the victims but also the school environment as a whole. The effects of school bullying are far-reaching and long-lasting for both the bully and victim. Victims of bullying often feel isolated, helpless, scared, vulnerable and worthless; this greatly affects their self-esteem which can lead to physical ailments such as sleeping disorders or stomach aches. In addition to emotional trauma, victims may experience anxiety or depression which can have an impact on academic performance over time – leading to lower grades than expected from them academically due to lack of concentration in classwork and/or avoidance tactics when they do attend classes at all!. For bullies themselves there are various consequences: firstly they are likely to face disciplinary action (which could include suspension); secondly being involved in anti-social behaviour like bullying increases one’s chances of having problems later on in life with employment prospects; lastly it reinforces negative traits within those individuals e.g., low self esteem which might cause the individual difficulty later down the line if left unchecked by adults or mentors providing guidance away from anything considered ‘anti social’ activity!. To combat this problem there needs to be a multi faceted approach taken by teachers/mentors & parents alike: schools should strive for zero tolerance policies regarding any form of abuse whilst also educating pupils about respect for each other so that these issues don't arise again once dealt with initially - likewise homes must ensure children are supported emotionally & cared for appropriately through positive reinforcement rather than criticism so peers won't target particular students out because they feel neglected elsewhere! Finally more research needs conducting into why people bully others so solutions targeted towards preventing this behaviour before it starts

"Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for both individuals and communities. The passages provided highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By implementing policies and initiatives to encourage car-free living, cities and suburbs can create more livable and sustainable environments.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the first passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help combat these issues and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. Cold nights and warm days can trap car emissions, resulting in smog that affects the health of residents. Implementing car-free initiatives can help reduce this pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Limiting car usage also encourages the use of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking. The third passage discusses the successful car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a healthier lifestyle and decreases the reliance on cars. By prioritizing public transportation and creating pedestrian-friendly cities, we can improve accessibility for everyone and reduce the need for car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive effects on urban planning and the design of suburbs. The second passage describes the district of Vauban in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but there are limited parking spaces available. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own a car. This approach encourages walking and cycling by placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. By reimagining the design of suburbs and prioritizing accessibility to public transportation and amenities, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable environments. Implementing car-free initiatives and prioritizing public transportation can lead to healthier and more accessible communities. It is important for individuals and governments to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a future with reduced car dependency.",1,"tensor([[-0.5623, -0.3012, -0.6833,  ..., -0.3590,  0.3093, -0.3911],

"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportation are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to fortythousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of vaughn's families do not even own cars, and fiftyseven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. vaughn's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in, Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, rollerskates, skateboards longboards, and penny boards, or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in, The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.",0,"tensor([[-0.0251, -0.2117, -0.1755,  ..., -0.0780,  0.8289,  0.1624],

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and create more vibrant and walkable neighborhoods. These benefits have been observed in various places around the world where car usage has been limited.

One example is Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars (Rosenthal, paragraph 3). This is because cars can be a source of tension and anxiety. In contrast, walking and biking in car-free neighborhoods can provide a sense of freedom and connection to the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and biking, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in cities where smog is a significant problem. Paris implemented a driving ban in response to severe smog, and congestion decreased by 60 percent (Duffer, paragraph 14). This demonstrates how reducing car usage can have an immediate positive impact on air quality. Diesel fuel, often favored in France due to tax policies, is a major contributor to air pollution (Duffer, paragraph 16). Encouraging the use of cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles or bikes, can help combat this issue.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to create more vibrant and walkable communities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day is held annually, during which millions of people use alternative modes of transportation. This event aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Selsky, paragraph 21). Such initiatives can lead to the construction of bike paths, parks, and improved infrastructure for pedestrians. As a result, neighborhoods become more accessible, enjoyable, and conducive to social interaction.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and create more vibrant neighborhoods. Initiatives in various parts of the world have demonstrated the positive impact of limiting car usage, and it is essential that more communities adopt measures to encourage alternative modes of transportation. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,"tensor([[-0.4678, -0.4149, -0.8061,  ..., -0.0130,  0.0790, -0.1256],

"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. One example of a community that has successfully implemented this concept is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few main thoroughfares and designated parking areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this car-free community (Rosenthal, 2009). This experiment in low-car suburban life is part of a larger trend in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world to separate suburbs from excessive car usage (Rosenthal, 2009). 

The reduction of car usage in suburbs is crucial as it directly addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage in suburbs, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions.

One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable transportation options. In Vauban, for example, the community is designed in a way that promotes walking and biking. Stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located on distant highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This kind of smart planning not only reduces the need for cars, but also encourages healthier and more active lifestyles.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on congestion and air pollution. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog caused by excessive car emissions. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and significantly improved air quality in the city (Duffer, 2014). This demonstrates the immediate benefits that can be achieved by reducing car usage in densely populated areas.

Furthermore, car-free initiatives such as the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, have been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky, 2002). These initiatives not only improve air quality, but also help to create a sense of community by encouraging people to engage in activities such as hiking, biking, and skating together.

The shift away from car culture is not limited to specific areas or communities. Studies in the United States have shown a decrease in the number of miles driven per person, suggesting that Americans are driving less and potentially reaching a point of peak driving (Rosenthal, 2013). This shift in behavior has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable transportation options, reducing congestion and air pollution, and fostering a sense of community. Initiatives such as car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days are just a few examples of how this concept is being implemented around the world. As we continue to make progress in limiting car usage, we move closer to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1,"tensor([[-0.4692, -0.3372, -0.4364,  ..., -0.1363,  0.3777, -0.1715],

Even in paragraph 8 in this story it says ""Striving to meet the challemge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".

"Senator XYZ,

I am writing as a citizen and voter of our great state to discuss an issue that I believe is central to our democracy: the method in which we elect the President of the United States. I am aware of the ongoing discussions regarding either keeping the Electoral College or moving to choosing our president by popular vote. After careful consideration and examination of numerous perspectives and sources, I argue in favor of preserving the Electoral College system.

Although the Electoral College has been criticized—for lack of direct democracy, for the focus on swing states, and for the potential discrepancy with the national popular vote—it serves pertinent roles in our electoral process. As noted in the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College provides five compelling reasons for its maintenance. Escape from a national dispute over the popular vote allows for a guaranteed and certain outcome (18). It propels a presidential candidate to appeal beyond regional boundaries, fostering a sense of belonging among voters across the nation (19). It gives crucial attention to the swing states, encouraging the voters of these states to be more engaged and thoughtful in their electoral decision (20). It tips the balance back towards larger states, which lose some of their influence due to the equal representation in the Senate (21). Additionally, it prevents the nation from the complication and burden of run-off elections, even when the popular vote remains inconclusive (22).

The views presented in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer also deserve due consideration. Plumer argues that the Electoral College can lead to confusions and potential mishaps like 'disaster scenarios' and faithless electors acting against voters' will (11). However, as Posner points out, such incidents have been rare (16) and the trust in electors has generally been upheld within the Electoral College system (15).

The Electoral College system also galvanizes the voters who do exercise their right despite their awareness that their single vote would unlikely tip the national scales, a testimony to their willingness to express political preference rather than indifference or disenchantment (23). Therefore, we must invest more in raising awareness about the workings of the Electoral College and more importantly, in fostering an environment that encourages participation in this great democratic exercise. 

In conclusion, while the Electoral College presents certain challenges, I believe the robust nature of this system has proven its value over the past centuries and made necessary adaptations to the changing times. I urge you to support preserving the Electoral College, while also advocating for more voter education and engagement to evolve and improve our democracy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.5454, -0.1480, -0.8766,  ..., -0.0320,  0.5754,  0.5567],

"There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on individual perspective. However, from a young person's perspective, they generally enjoy life more than older people. This is likely due to the fact that they are still learning and exploring new things, which can be exciting and stimulating. Additionally, they may not have as many responsibilities or commitments that take up their time, which allows them to focus on the things that are important to them. Older people, on the other hand, may have experienced more of life and may have a richer experience to draw on. They may also have more experience dealing with difficult situations, which can make them more resilient and able to handle life's challenges. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide how they enjoy life, and the age gap in question is only one factor to consider.

"12% of all green house gas in Europe is from is from car emissions and up to 50% in the United States. The earth needs a change while it still can. Theres already many countries that are trying to do something, France the U.S. and Colombia just to name a few. Taking a break and not driving cars has so many pros and very little cons. Yes, you might have to walk and might lose some weight but it may decide how much longer humans can stay on earth.

What comes out of your car, that's what you are breathing. Would you rather breath burn gasoline fumes or fresh clean air? Its your choice, every year billions of people driving cars that are releasing a gas ,CO2, into the air which is poisonous to humans. What happens after the world gets full of it? I honestly don't want to see.

Not only is car pooling and taking public transportation cheaper that paying for gas but it also helps keep the green house gasses down more that if everyone was driving. A recent study by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives shows that more Americans are driving less cars every year. Join your fellow Americans, you won't regret it.

Soon enough cars are going to get banned and fines will be put in place that are given to people who drive gas powered cars. Do you really want this to happen? People getting fined just because they had to go to work or to see there family? I'm pretty sure you o don't, so lets make the world a little more car free. Then thus make the world CO2 free.

Now there's a relatively new car that runs on electric. Although these cars are not exactly cheap, but they are motorless and gasless and they don't release CO2 into the atmosphere and they look nice too. If that doen't suit you there is a hydrogen powered car coming out in 2015. If you dont think you can handle that then there is always busses, taxis and bikes. Then if you still can't find something you like there's walking, humans where built with legs, use them.

Think about how you want your children and there children to live there lifes and how you and the rest of the earth can effect them and how you can keep there lifes free of poisonus CO2.

"Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. By limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn't being poluted as much and there aren't as many traffic jams.

For starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. For example, a German suburb, Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. Rosenthal states, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" Not only does it cost 40,000 just for that but gas and fixups go along with having a car.

Secondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. For instance, Paris issued a driving ban in an effort to ""clear the air of the global city."" Duffer says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The smog that affects Paris is also known to ""rival"" with Bejing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area.

Lastly, it's obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" It's a positive thing to have ""carfree day"" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.

To conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.",0,"tensor([[-0.1741, -0.1358, -0.4724,  ..., -0.1861,  0.9194,  0.0711],

"Dear State Senator,

The purpose of me writing to you is because, i agree that we should change the way we vote for our president. Everyone has a right to vote but dont you think a easy prosses would be much bette? there are many reasons i disagree with using Electoral Collage but there are way to many reasons so im only going to give a three. my three reasons on why we should not you eletoral college is because the prosses, the problems, and finally because its old.

The electoral collage lets be honest is a huge big unfair process. There are very many steps to the Electoral collage and i belive there are many more ways we can vote. Picking the hardest one in my personal opion is just not to bright. We should have a easy way to help the people running the electoal collage and also help the citizens. There are many resons why doing this wil;l halp the process so we will have our president voted faster.

The eletoral collage has very many problems in its system. a few of them are that when the citizens vote they are not voting for the president they are voting for the elcetors who vote for the presidents. Another reason is Eletoral collage is very unfair. The peeople or the electors that are voting are not always the right ones also depending on which side you are on rpublican or the decmocratic sometimes een for example you are a republican one of your electors could be democratic as i said before very unfair.

Finally everyone gets tired of crummy old boring things! Have you ever hear it is good to try new things? lets face it the system is really old. I believe would shold try differant methods of selecting the president. If for any reason it does not work out we can always try something else or go back too the same way. i belive that we should try something new and not the same old boring unfair way we have been using for years.

All in all i belive  that we should change the way we vote for the president. This eletoral collage from my understaning is not something we should keep using. As i said there are to many reason that i would have to write down but here are my three reasons to change the way we vote. First the prosses of picking the president, second the problems that the eletoral college has, and last because the system is old and needs to change so, no that you have read this are you going to help me and everyone else change this system?

in my respect, PROPER_NAME",0,"tensor([[ 0.1848, -0.1177,  0.4368,  ..., -0.3358,  0.5760,  0.5235],

"People sometimes have a different opinion than others and that is fine. For example, my brother and I have a different opinion on what the best sport is. People having a different point of view is a reason that our society works so well. If everyone had the same one than our world would be kinda plain and boring. Learning different opinions is also important so you can see the impact your point of view has on your decision . Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you hear different thoughts that people have, you can learn something new, and it will help you become more creative.

First, hearing different opinions can help you make a better decision in many ways. One way is when people give opinions they are trying to show you that there opinion is right. For example, if I were to say that soccer was the best sport, than I would give you all the evidence that I have to show that it is the best sport. When you ask multiple people most of the time you will get different point of views. When you get multiple opinions than you should pick the one you believe in. In conclusion, getting different point of views is a good thing to do when you are making a decision that you need help with.

Second, you can learn something new from someone's point of view. Something that you may learn from someone's opinion is the good and the bad from there decision. When someone is giving you an opinion they may have had to make this decision before. This person can explain the good and the bad part of making this decision. For example, if someone were to tell ask me for my opinion about going to Generic_Name Park I would tell them that it was a lot of fun but it was also very crowded. When you are given a opinion you should try to learn from that persons mistakes but also learn the good and the bad . Overall, there are many ways that you can learn from someone else opinion.

Finally, you can become more creative and use new ideas you have. When you hear the ideas of others, your brain starts to put things together and you come up with a new decision or idea. For example, when I listen to my mom giving me advice about something, I become a little more creative in my idea and decision. You become more creative when you are listening to the mistakes they made but also the things that ended up working in there decision. When you get new ideas you should'nt be afraid of using them. Finally, when you are listening you just need to get creative and come up with new ideas.

In conclusion, getting opinions from other people can help you in many ways. Hearing others decisions and mistakes can help you make a smarter decision. When you learn from others mistakes you make the decision they should have made in the first place. When you get all these opinions your brain starts to come up with new ideas and you become more creative when making your decision. Listening to other people and there point of views can make a big difference in what you think afterwards. Overall, to make a smart decision you need to listen to the mistakes that other people have made so that you can make a smart and good decision yourself.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2250, -0.3129, -0.6187,  ...,  0.0437,  0.4860,  0.0446],

"The impact of technology on education has been one of the most widely discussed topics in recent years. As technology has advanced, it is becoming increasingly common for classrooms to use computers and other forms of digital equipment as teaching tools. There are several advantages to using this type of technology in the classroom, but there are also potential drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One clear advantage to incorporating technology into an educational setting is that students can easily access a wide variety of resources with just the click of a button. With more traditional methods, students would have had to manually search through books or visit libraries in order to find information they needed for their studies; however, now they can quickly locate what they need online and often times even watch video tutorials or listen to audio lectures related to their subject matter. This makes learning more efficient and effective since students no longer need travel long distances or spend time trying hard to find resources themselves. Additionally, technological advancements have allowed instructors and teachers new opportunities when it comes lesson planning and delivering material effectively. For instance, educators may utilize videos from YouTube or podcasts from iTunes U instead of having lengthy lectures during class which could allow them cover more content within a shorter amount of time while still ensuring student comprehension by providing different forms stimulating media outlets such as images or infographics along with text-based explanations clearly explaining concepts being taught in class; this could ultimately lead higher grades among students overall due its engaging nature compared traditional instruction methods alone used prior technological advances made over past few decades. . However, there are some potential downsides associated with implementing too much technology within an academic setting as well such as how easy it can become for students rely heavily upon internet searches complete assignments meant challenge critical thinking skills rather than think deeply about problem solving strategies themselves without help from external sources . Additionally , usage levels computer hardware such tablets laptops projectors etc increase rapidly depending school district budget cuts funds may not always available replace outdated versions models .

"The debate between allocating more money for immediate, existing social problems versus spending money on long-term research to help future generations is a difficult one. On one hand, spending resources on immediate, existing social problems would provide direct benefits to people today. For example, resources could be spent on providing adequate housing, education, and healthcare to people facing poverty. On the other hand, investing in long-term research could benefit future generations, resulting in advancements in technology, medicine, and science that could improve the overall quality of life for generations to come.

I believe that it is more important to allocate money for immediate, existing social problems. The world is a difficult place right now, with poverty and inequality rampant in many parts of the world. Allocating money to address immediate, existing social problems would bring immediate relief to those in need. For example, providing a family with access to food security, education, and medical care could help them to break out of the cycle of poverty, providing them with a better chance of succeeding in life.

In addition, allocating money to immediate, existing social problems can be a more effective use of resources. Research and development often involve long-term, expensive projects that might not always yield the desired results. For instance, research into alternative energy sources has been ongoing for many years, but the results have been slow in coming and expensive in terms of resources. Allocating these resources to help those in need would more likely result in tangible, immediate benefits.

Finally, allocating resources to immediate, existing social problems has a greater potential to reduce inequality. In many parts of the world, there is a huge gap between the haves and the have-nots, with some people having access to basic necessities like healthcare and education while others do not. Investing in projects to address these issues can help to bridge this gap and reduce inequality.

In conclusion, while it is important to invest in research and development that could benefit future generations, it is more important to allocate money for immediate, existing social problems. Investing in immediate, existing social problems can bring tangible, immediate benefits to those in need, be a more effective use of resources, and help to reduce inequality.

"Pollution is one of the most dangerous causes in the world. However, people need the things that pollutes the air. Such as cars, body sprays,etc. I agree that the citizens should limit car usage.

Fuel is one of the causes that pollutes the air. According to the passage,""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" In addition to that, diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in france. Compared to a 53.3 percent average engines in the rest of western europe. Robert Duffer states that, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of global city."" Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Moreover, the same goes for odd-numbered plates. With that, the smog cleared enough for the ruling french party.

All the countries should try a car-free day. Andrew Selsky said, ""In a program that set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the car-free day."" Some of the advantages of having a car-free day can help make people see that its not about cars or bikes. Even so, Those things are just damaging the air and making it harder to live and breathe. Also stated in the article was that, "" It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by board, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Futhermore, it would help so people can see the world without cars and not pollute the air.

By giving some of the dangerous stuff that we use daily a break. We will see great turn outs and good things happen. Like, less traffic which means less accidents, less fuel used which means less pollution. Lets all help keep our country safe and clean. STOP POLLUTION! I firmly agree that citizens should limit car usage.",0,"tensor([[-0.1309, -0.0703, -0.2462,  ..., -0.2132,  0.5854,  0.2779],

"Traveling is an exciting and rewarding experience that can open up a world of possibilities. It can be a great way to learn about different cultures, explore new places, and make new friends. However, there are many different ways to travel, and it can be difficult to decide which is best. Some people prefer to travel independently, while others prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

One of the main advantages of traveling in a group led by a tour guide is that it can be much more efficient and cost-effective. Tour guides are knowledgeable about the area and can help you make the most of your time. They can provide you with information about the best places to visit, the best restaurants to eat at, and the best activities to do. They can also help you avoid tourist traps and save money by finding discounts and deals. Additionally, traveling in a group can help you save money on transportation costs, as you can often get group discounts on flights, buses, and trains.

Another advantage of traveling in a group led by a tour guide is that it can be much safer. Tour guides are experienced and knowledgeable about the area, so they can help you avoid dangerous situations. They can also provide you with information about the local laws and customs, so you can be sure to stay out of trouble. Additionally, traveling in a group can provide you with a sense of security, as you will always have someone to look out for you.

Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be a great way to make new friends. Tour guides are often friendly and outgoing, and they can help you meet other travelers who share your interests. You can learn about different cultures and experiences from the people you meet, and you may even make lifelong friends.

In conclusion, I believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Tour guides can help you make the most of your time, save money, stay safe, and make new friends. They can provide you with an unforgettable experience that you will never forget.

"Limiting car usuage would help the world In so many ways. First of all, there wouldn't be that much people getting hurt from car crashes. Also cars were affecting France by letting out to much smog. Cold nights and warm days had affected the warmer layer of air to trap emissions. If you limit car usage then you wouldn't have that problem.

Another advantage would be that you wouldn't be Inhaling as much polluted air If cars were limited. Polluted air Isn't good to Inhale and also will mess with people allergies so that would definitely be a big advantage. If car usage Is limited, more people would be active. That would help with people's health and decrease the number of lazy people we have In this world.

Plus If another advantage would be that beneficial Implications for carbon emissions and the environment. It would definitely help with that since car transportation Is the second largest source of America's emission. Carbon emissions play a pretty big role to so benefiting that would be fantastic. Limiting car usage would also help you save money by not having to repair your car. You won't have to take It to get checked by a mechanic every three months. You would be saving thousands of dollars If you limited car usage.

The day without cars Is the day that Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Also the parks and sports centers have bloomed through the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. Another advantage Is that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. New restaurants and upscale shopping districts have Increased.

There would be many advantages of limiting car usage. People will find a type of way to benefit themselves from it. It would also be way much better air we Inhale If cars are limited.

"It is often said that ""change is good."" This saying is one way to describe my feelings towards the Electoral College. The sources ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral Collegemay disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is emphasized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're technically not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph sixof ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voterswant to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibility of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""Richard A. Posnerstates ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one.If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.",0,"tensor([[-0.9070,  0.2176, -0.8824,  ..., -0.5159,  0.3494,  0.5564],

"The issue of whether a family should tell a cancer patient the truth has been a contentious one in recent years, particularly in the Chinese culture. On the one hand, some people argue that this traditional practice should be changed along with the development of modernization. On the other hand, some people argue that it'should remain the same. In this essay, I will argue that this traditional practice should be changed and that families should tell cancer patients the truth.

First of all, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their treatment, which could lead to poorer outcomes and a worse prognosis. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not seek out the best possible treatment and the cancer may ultimately become more serious. This could have serious implications for the patient’s health and wellbeing.

Secondly, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the emotional support they need to deal with their diagnosis. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to process their emotions and may not be able to access the support they need. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the emotional support they need to cope with the diagnosis and may become overwhelmed by the situation.

Finally, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the best possible quality of life. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their care and may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life.

In conclusion, it is important for families to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment, have the emotional support they need to cope with their diagnosis, and have the best possible quality of life. In the Chinese culture, this traditional practice should be changed to ensure that cancer patients are able to make informed decisions about their care and access the support they need.

"The advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers that are found within the driving experience, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere.

The andvantage that can be found with limiting car usage can help to be protected from the dangers found within driving. Source 1 explains how Heidrun Walter feels ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Walking and other ways of getting around, other than cars can help people go to places and have that advantage, as source 3 implies ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" our technology has been growing at a quick pace and as source 4 mentions "" Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" All of these new ideas has led to the conclusion that cars are not needed since all these second choices are present.

The Advantage of limiting car usage can help and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy or atmosphere. Source 1 concludes "" Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in europe."" Cars are the main reason why our earth can be in danger from all these gases. People need to follow what businessman Carlos Arturo said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  Some countries such as Paris has all ready taken this advantage, source 2 mentions, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If people have tryied this change in their lives, others such as one self can too.

The advantages of limiting car usage can be a great way to be protected from the dangers of driving, and support the amount and less usage of greenhouse gas that can destroy our atmosphere.

Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills.

"Have you ever been in a situation where you don't know what to do? So of course, like any other person would when they are in need of assistance, you ask somebody else about their take on the situation. And you may be thinking to yourself

"" Well one other opinion is all I need "" right?, WRONG! There are tons of reasons why getting numerous opinions is a lot more helpful then if you didn't.

One reason why I believe it is important to seek multiple opinions is because everyone is unique and has their own point of views. Talking to someone who has had to deal with the same situation you're in can help tons when coming to obtaining advice. For example if you want to pursue your dream as a film maker you're obviously gonna want to go to someone who has experience and interest in making films, where as if you go to someone who has no interest or knowledge at all you're gonna get a totally different response because not everybody sees things in the same way.

Another reason why it is important to seek multiple opinions is because some people can have a very heavy bias on certain subjects. Picture this, you're thinking about going out and doing something so you decide to ask a friend what they think about it. They so happen to have a bad experience with it so obviously their opinion on it is not going to be a very good one because they have a bias. Just because somebody else had a bad experience doesn't necessarily mean it will go that way for you, but also same thing goes for a good experience someone else may have had.

And finally a last reason why it is very important to seek multiple opinions is because it will help you see all the pros and cons surrounding your idea. Of course its easy to talk to people who think just like you because you will both have the same beliefs and can both also agree and many things, but sometimes that's not always the best idea. Communicating with somebody who has a different perspective can be just as useful if not maybe even more. This is allowing you to see things from totally different points of view which well help you see the pros and cons that you may not have even realized before.

In conclusion the best thing to do when you're in need of advice, seeking multiple opinions is the way to go. It will allow you to see from different point of views that you yourself might have never even thought of.",0,"tensor([[ 7.9685e-02, -2.6296e-01, -5.5853e-01,  ..., -3.0446e-01,

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The following topics the author used helped support this idea: the challenges, dangers, and the fasinations with Venus needs to be explored.

Our neighboring ""twin,"" that we can only observe by hovering far above it hopping to get as much detail as possible, creats a challenge due to how unsafe it is. Our scientists have ""sent numerous spacecrafts"" to Venus. But, each previous mission was unmanned because, no spacecraft survived the landing for mpore than a few hours. Also, due to the high pressures and heat on this planet there is ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on the surface.""

Due to the challenges, it makes it so much more dangerous. Since,

Venus is second to our sun and has an ""atmosphere of 97 precent carbon dioxide blanket"" and a tempeture average over 800 degrees Fahrinheit."" It makes it really hard for NASA to get a close look do to Venus's unsafe tempertures. Also, Venus has an ""atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what us humans experiance on our own plant."" Which is way ""more extreme than anything we have had to encounter."" Plus, if NASA were able to find away to float thirty-plus miles above the suface it ""would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit."" But, on the bright side ""it would have the air pressure close to at sea level on earth.""

But, despite these challenges and dangers there is plenty of fasinations with this planet. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Also, Venus still has some features similar to earth such as: valleys, mountains, and craters. Making more scientist to want to explore it to see if it was once habital by other creatures. Further more, making then to suspect that ""Venus was probably once covered largely with oceans.""

Based on the author hitting the points that exploring Venus can be challenging, dangerous, but yet fasinating helps get across the fact the he feels like despite the dangers Venus presents it is still a worthy prusuit to study.",0,"tensor([[-0.8409, -0.0089, -0.2647,  ..., -0.1751,  1.3761,  0.1471],

70 percent of vaubans's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to here."" when i had a car i was always tense . I'm much happier this way ,"" said heidrm walter , a media trainer and mother of two

In 2006 vauban completed a growing trend,the united states to separate suburban auto use .that was called ""smart planning"". smart planning became effective and it started to happen . The upper class had a advantage ..money. the upper class got to have a nice cars because they had more money thena middle calss so this was good because that meant less wealth and so less cars then less polution and save natural resources .

"History has always been an interesting and fascinating subject for many people to study. It's a way to learn about the past, what happened in different places around the world, who or what caused events, and how it all came together to shape our present reality. The study of history can be both inspiring and intimidating as we delve into facts from times long gone by. No matter which period of time you choose to focus on, there is something unique and exciting to explore. Take Ancient Greece for example; it was a civilization that had some of the greatest contributions known in human history. From their philosophy to art, literature, architecture and more – they were truly ahead of their time with many ideas still resonating today. Their impact on society cannot be understated when considering the development of democracy and other governmental structures that are still used today across the world’s nations. It’s easy enough to get lost in historical texts regarding Ancient Greece but if one takes a step back they will find incredible stories told among their ruins throughout mainland Europe itself including Delphi which played host at one point in time for dramatic competitions between famous playwrights such as Euripides amongst others! These tales have not only left behind physical evidences like monuments or amphitheaters but also deep lessons from those who experienced them first-hand - even thousands of years ago these same messages remain valid for us now here in our own life journey through space-time!. . In conclusion, understanding history is essential for us humans because it serves as an anchor that keeps us grounded within our trajectory – helping maintain social stability while allowing progress towards future developments however far away those may seem right now! Taking a look into this vast web woven by countless individuals across eras helps bring clarity amidst uncertainty; providing insight into ourselves & shaping up our decisions based off lessons learnt instead of repeating mistakes made centuries ago when faced with similar situations today…

"Is Texting Worth Your Life

In the United States the number one cause of motor accidents are distracted drivers, evidently these are people who text and drive. People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in todays generation. Some people think that they are a experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.

The National Safety Council reports that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". These statistics are frightening and eye opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to a AAA poll ""94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyways."" Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.

The risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.

"The answer to this question is difficult to determine. On one hand, the internet has allowed for a greater amount of information to be available at the fingertips of people than ever before. On the other hand, books and written works have been around for centuries and are often revered as the main source of information. There are many proponents of the idea that the internet will never completely replace the book or the written word, as there are many advantages to having written works available for reference. For example, written works can be more easily edited and modified, making them more accurate and up-to-date. Additionally, written works can be shared with a wider audience more easily than information that is available online. Overall, it is difficult to determine whether or not the internet will completely replace the book or the written word as the main source of information. However, the internet has certainly made information available to a wider audience than ever before and has allowed for more accurate and up-to-date information to be available to people.

"what do you think about smartphones? Smartphones make it easy for us to be connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, etc. How do you feel about the use of cellphones while driving? Well, about 660,000 drivers attempt using a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Rates for cell phone distractions are extremely high. Do you think that it would be okay to use cellphones while driving? I feel that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it affects their ability to drive, causes car accidents and people die.

People's driving could easily be affected by the use of a cell phone. It can be a distraction physically and cognitively. The physical distraction occurs when they are using the cellphone while driving their vehicle. Cognitive distraction occurs when drivers give their attention to the phone instead of the road. However, the ability to give your attention to both of these tasks are limited.

Statistics show that driving and using a cellphone is more common for which can be very dangerous. According to ""National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes each year. 341,000 involved text messaging, and 1.2 million involed drivers talking on the phone. The statistics show that this multitasking while operating a vehicle is becoming life threatening. Research from ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)""

says, teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any throwbacks. If they don't use their phones they would be able to pay attention to driving, be less likely to have a crash, most importantly, they would be following the law.

Car crashes end up causing very fatal injuries and death. Driving while texting is 6 times more likely to cause car crashes than driving while intoxicated. There are nearly 390,000 injuries caused by texting and driving yearly. Approximately 6,000 people were killed by texting and driving in the past year. Checking a text takes 5 seconds of a driver's attention away from driving when they could be used on the road.

Overall, I feel that using a cellphone while driving shouldn't be allowed because it causes car accidents affects driving and kills people. 1.6 million car accidents, 1 out of 4 of them yearly involves texting while driving. This could be changed. Limit your cellphone use. Just think how many lives can be saved. Think of the car crash rate, they will dwindle. Before driving and after check your phone.

When aiming for success, one must decide whether to aim high or to aim low. On the one hand, aiming high can give people the ambition and motivation to work hard and become the best they can be. If they succeed, they will likely gain satisfaction, recognition and self-esteem. However, this method may lead to disappointment and discontent if the aspirations are not achieved. On the other hand, aiming low may lead to a sense of comfort and complacency in reaching more attainable goals, but these successes will not be as significant as when one has taken a risk with more challenging targets. 

In conclusion, it is important to determine a reasonable balance between aiming high and aiming low. Having ambitious goals encourages us to challenge ourselves and strive for better, while aiming low enables us to be mindful of our limits in order to set achievable goals that we can be proud of.",1,"tensor([[-0.1408, -0.0816, -0.3687,  ..., -0.4536,  0.0799,  0.6518],

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system in presidential elections. While there are valid arguments to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that should be considered. I have thoroughly analyzed the information from various sources and would like to present my case based on the texts provided.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, which is less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. As highlighted in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a landslide victory, minimizing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This stability in outcome ensures that the election process does not suffer from prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College system is that it promotes the representation of all regions and discourages candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, regional favorites without nationwide appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents. Under the Electoral College, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the president represents various regions of the country and takes into account the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The third advantage of the Electoral College system lies in its promotion of swing states. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winner-take-all approach incentivizes candidates to focus on competitive states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention, leading to better-informed and thoughtful decision-making. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are more likely to engage with citizens, discuss important issues, and address the concerns of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance regarding the influence of large states versus small states. Large states, as Bradford Plumer highlights in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This helps prevent the political disadvantages that large states face as a consequence of the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing a larger political weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign across both large and small states, guaranteeing a more inclusive approach to the electorate.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and challenges associated with run-off elections and maintains the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system can discourage some potential voters in states where their preferred candidate does not have a chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of eligible American citizens still exercise their right to vote in presidential elections. As voters, we express our political preferences and values, regardless of the potential impact of our individual votes on the national outcome. The Electoral College does not prevent citizens from engaging in the electoral process but ensures that all states and regions have a meaningful role in electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, as established by our founding fathers, offers crucial benefits that should be taken into consideration. It promotes stability in election outcomes, encourages the representation of all regions, focuses campaigns on competitive swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider these points in your decision-making as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives presented in this letter along with the information provided in the supporting texts. I look forward to witnessing your thoughtful determination on this matter that affects our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-0.6774, -0.2026, -0.5895,  ..., -0.1866,  0.2356,  0.5887],

"Imagine your trying to decide on a hair color, Red, Green, Blue or Black? You have no idea. This is why sometimes you need multiple opinions on what to do. So you go around you ask friends their responses are all different you dont know what to do. So you have to find a another person to help you out.

Dying your hair a different color is not an easy task, you need to decide from the hundreds of shades and colors they have for you to use. Between simple colors like Blue, Red, Blue and Black. You need multiple people to ask what color you should get but, what if those people all choose different colors for you to use. This is why you need multiple opinions.

But guess what that person says the color you dont want to do. What do you do? Get more opinions or just give up? You keep going, you wanted to dye your hair in the first place so you need to figure out what your gonna do. You're gonna narrow down your list to less and ask 5 people again what color should I dye my hair?

After getting multiple opinions you are going to get your hair the color blue. Most of your friends said you should get it blue. They helped you settle what color you should dye your hair.

In conclusion, Getting multiple opinions is the way to go. Whether deciding where to eat where to go or what color your hair should be.

"Seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because some people have bias opinions on different topics, some people aren't educated on certain topics and others are, and you can learn and understand more about both sides opinions, and why exactly they feel that way.

People have bias opinions on certain topics for many different reasons. Being bias means that you feel strongly about one side of something. For example, Republicans and Democrats, most people that are very into politics are normally bias about the side that they are supporting. Some reasons why people are bias is because of the way they were raised or maybe the reason is where they were born. Whatever the reason is, people can be very bias.

Some people aren't very educated on certain topics depending on if they actually care or pay attention to the topic. For example, some people really get into politics, pay a lot of attention to it, stay updated, and talk about it a lot. On the other hand some people don't really get into it very much and don't pay to much attention to it. It really all just depends on how the person truly feels about it, and how important the person thinks it is.

Asking for other peoples opinions about a certain topic is a good way to get to know more about both sides, and learn how and why they feel about certain things. Some people might feel one way about something, and another person feels the exact opposite then how the other person feels. In that case, you get to hear and learn about how both sides feel, and why they exactly they feel that away about the topic. It's good to hear both sides because your opinion might completely change, or maybe you'll begin to start having a more neutral opinion about the topic.

"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldn't want to graduate a year early right? but in the end it's not even worth it.

I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesn't make you more than them, it doesn't make any student seem smart, it's just them taking the short cut to end school.

I believe it isn't a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resume's, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished.

Another reason why I dont think it's a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students who'd want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, don't do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isn't a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesn't make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isn't the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that don't even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job that'll pay you well and something that you know you'll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months.

For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who don't plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just don't take the school serious but only if they knew that, that's the key for them to open to get to their future.

If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, I'd think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that they'd want to get a head start with their career. That's good I'm not saying it's bad, it's just something I wouldn't do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity.

In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life. School may not be the best but it can sure give you the best career life.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1422, -0.3528, -0.2739,  ..., -0.2586,  0.7066, -0.2009],

"Dear senator,

The electoral process is extremely unfair to all the people and citizens in the united states and its totally messed up. The president is not what the citizens vote for but instead they're voting for electors who elects the president. Also there is a ""winner takes it all"" system that is even more messsed up. This should definitely be changed to a popular voting process because it's 100x more fair. In this process it's the people that get to vote for the president, not the electors and there is no such thing as a ""winner takes it all system,"" which gives citizens more rights.

According to the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , candidates dont spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didnt see the candidates at all. This is extremely unfair because almost have the states didnt even get to see the campaign!! The most important thing when it comes to electing a president is everyone knowing about it and everyone voting but the whole idea is controversal. Now if there was no such thing as an electoral college system then there wouldnt be a ""winner takes it all"" system and there wouldnt be a big mess. The citizens should be the ones electing the president because I believe that it is the citizens right to choose who they want as their president. The president is the one that is serving the Citizens and decides whats good and bad for them, not the electors. Citizens are the ones that make up a country, without them would there even be a thing as ""the united states?""

I know that you may think that a electoral process is better than popular voting because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have a trans- regional appeal. According to the article

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , that means that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This is a good idea, but not the best idea. If we decided the president by popluar vote then this whole thing would be different, we wouldnt have to worry about electoral votes in the regions. Instead we would combine all the popular votes in all of the states to see who has the most votes.

As you can probably tell popular voting is so much better than electoral college. Electoral college is too stressful and competely unfair. While popular voting is Easy, simple, and extremely fair to everyone living in the United States. Imagine just the citizens voting for the president and counting the votes and then being done. Now imagine the citizens voting for electors and then counting the votes for that, then having the electors vote for the president and then counting for that. Which is easier and better? If I were you I say that the popular vote is better and I'd change the future elections to popular vote.",0,"tensor([[-0.5199, -0.0869, -0.3983,  ..., -0.8880,  0.7987,  0.4845],

Dear [State Senator's name],

I am writing to express my thoughts regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from various sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained for several compelling reasons.

The first reason to keep the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Posner explains, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and provides a clear winner. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This stability in outcome is crucial for maintaining a strong and confident leadership.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents a broad range of interests by requiring trans-regional appeal. With no single region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to multiple regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the Presidency, ensuring that the elected President represents the entire nation and not just a specific region or majority.

Additionally, the swing states in the Electoral College system play a vital role in promoting an engaged and informed electorate. Plumer points out that candidates focus their campaign efforts on swing states, encouraging voters in those states to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful choices. By allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election, the Electoral College ensures that the Presidency is in the hands of those who have taken the time to genuinely evaluate the candidates and their policies.

The Electoral College also balances political power between large and small states, addressing the mal-apportionment of the Senate's representation. As Posner highlights, the Electoral College gives proportionate attention to large states in presidential campaigns, encouraging candidates to address the concerns and interests of citizens in those states. This balanced approach prevents unduly focusing on highly populated regions while disregarding the needs and perspectives of smaller states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the complexities of run-off elections that may occur when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College upholds the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process, eliminating the need for additional rounds of voting and potential confusion.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, I believe that voter turnout is driven by the desire to express a political preference rather than the expectation of deciding the outcome of the election. As evidenced by the high turnout in previous elections, voters participate in the democratic process to have their voices heard and values represented.

In conclusion, retaining the Electoral College is essential for maintaining certainty, broad representation, an engaged electorate, a balanced distribution of power, and a clear winner in presidential elections. I urge you to consider these reasons and support the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of choosing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-1.0268, -0.0711, -1.2954,  ..., -0.2537,  0.3142,  0.4377],

Doing school work at home offers students a variety of benefits. One of the main advantages is the opportunity to take regular breaks and regroup before tackling another task. This can help students stay focused and engaged while completing their school work. Working on the computer is also a great benefit, as students are able to track their progress and find information quickly. Staying with family can also provide comfort and support when tackling difficult tasks or answering challenging questions. Although studying and completing school work at home may not be as comfortable as being in the classroom, it can lead to increased levels of distraction and avoiding procrastination.

"Conserving energy and resources should not mean that children should go to school for only four day and 2 hours. Children are not going to be able to process what there laurning.

Two hours, you are not going to laurn nothing, time is most inportant to many people. People will need more then 2 hours. Teachers most inportint need more time to work.

"The limiting of cars in our community can help us significantly reduce pollution, save money, and improve health.

To begin with, the amount of pollution caused by cars has dramatically effected the enviroment. Acording to the text the capital of France in only five days of car smog. The amount of smog riveled to the smog capital of the world Beijing, China. That was only five days of car smog. If we keep this up, the  first the sky will turn black and then it will fall and world will end! Hopefully nobody wants the world to end because of smog. To reduce the amount of smog and pollution caused by cars we can all reduce the usege of our cars. Therfore, the limiting of cars can significantly reduce pollution.

Next, limiting cars can help us all save money. To illustrate, we all like that ""Cash Money"". And all cars need gas to work, and the funny thing about gas is it cost money; alot of money actually. So if the limited useage of cars happen then, is we save that ""Cash Money"". As you can see the reduction and limiting of cars can save us that ""Cash Money"".

Lastly, the limit of car useage can and will improve health by making people walk. You see people every where are getting over weight. So by makeing them walk or use other modes of transportation we can lose weight and improve health. Thus, the limiting the useage of cars can and will increase health.

To conclude, the limiting of cars in our community can help us significantly reduce pollution, save money, and improve health.",0,"tensor([[-0.3540,  0.0573, -0.4117,  ..., -0.6483,  0.6819,  0.0804],

"Arguements on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occuring today. Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College. This is because less disputes are likely to happen and not voting will not effect the election.

On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. In ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", author Bradford Plumer claims ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" because ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" This means that the candidates focus on the ""tight races of the 'swing' states."" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count;however, chaning to election by popular vote will cause mant disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.

To begin, the Electoral College is fair to the states, leaving fewer disputes. In ""Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.

In addition, the Electoral College method does not get affected by the ones who chose not to vote. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner states that ""knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign."" But, ""voters in presidential electons are people who want to express  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.",0,"tensor([[-0.7836, -0.1589, -0.8293,  ..., -0.2668,  0.5283,  0.5950],

In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.

Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.

As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students.

This essay will examine how this new wave of technological development has been positively impacting customer service in the retail sector. In today's economy, customers demand more personalized services than ever before. Companies can now capitalize on advanced communication methods to provide quicker response times and better meet customers' needs. Retailers are utilizing data analysis to gain insights into customer preferences which they can use to develop tailored recommendations or products that match their specific demands. In addition, automation has allowed companies to streamline processes while still improving quality control at all levels of production and support staff can take advantage of AI-powered chatbots for quick resolution time when customer inquiries arise that require complex answers or additional information gathering from external sources. Moreover, thanks to increasingly sophisticated software solutions retailers are able purchase inventory with greater accuracy by analyzing past purchases, trends in consumer behavior over time - thereby avoiding costly mistakes associated with inaccurate forecasting or poor sales strategy implementation due to lack of insight into key demographics (i.e age/gender etc.) . Furthermore blockchain technology is being used for secure payment processes reducing instances of fraud thus giving peace mind those partaking in ecommerce transactions that their personal details remain safe throughout the transaction process . . All these advances have led shoppers feeling valued rather seen as mere ‘transactions’; Henceforth it makes sense why its becoming increasingly common place for consumers become loyal fans both online via social media networks but also physical stores where they feel connected emotionally instead just making an economic exchange which often accompanied a certain level dissatisfaction with regard service received if not up par expectations due lengthy waiting times ill informed shop assistants etc.This type loyalty generates greater amounts referrals hence increasing revenue streams business whilst keeping costs low simultaneously through maintaining high standards customer service delivery even during peak periods trade e.g festive season approaching

"People have the opportunity to make life changing decisions everyday.

For example, choosing what college you are going to attend affects your future.

It is important that when making these life changing decisions you evaluate all your options.

No one should rush into a decision without making sure that they make a positive choice.

Making mistakes is important because it allows you to learn and discover new interests.

However, you do not want to make a mistake when you are making a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life.

During such important events talking to the people you trust helps you make a decision that is right for you.

Having multiple options is a very important thing to have when you are making a big decision.

It allows you to evaluate your choices, and it helps you discover all other possible outcomes before making a final decision.

By talking to multiple people you are able to learn about all possible scenarios that could occur from your choice.

Eventually after thinking about all the information you learn from talking to other people you can decide which opinion you agree with most.

Listening to what other people would do in a situation helps you discover more about your beliefs.

Discovering your beliefs also helps you clearly see what the right thing to do is.

Finally, after talking to multiple people your final decision is usually within reach.

Dealing with issues in a positive way is an important skill that everyone should have.

Taking advice can sometimes be a challenge, however, it can also help you make sure that you are kind when dealing with serious issues.

Talking to family members that you trust allows you to take the best advice that will help you with your problem.

This allows you to listen to the opinions of multiple people which will help you decide which choice relates to you the most.

Making healthy choices is very important, and listening to others gives you the ability to do that.

Another reason that it is important to talk to others when making a big decision is because it prevents you from making a mistake.

When facing big decisions you do not want to make a mistake that you will regret later on.

Reaching out to multiple people and listening to their opinions can help you discover when you are about to make a mistake.

This method of problem solving can also help you learn from your mistakes before you make them.

Which is why listening to others is an important thing to do throughout your life.

Asking other people for advice is something that everyone has to do at some point during their life.

Talking to multiple people is a method that allows positive outcomes from these conversations.

Even if you don't take advice from one of the people that you talk to, it is still important to listen to what they have to say.

This is because sometimes just listening to other people can allow you to discover what you think is right.

You do not always have to agree with the opinions of others, however, their stories have the ability to teach you valuable life lessons.

Remembering these stories is important because it allows you to not make the same mistakes.

Instead, you can make your own mistakes and decisions throughout your life.

These decisions, are stories that you wil tell later in life to other people, to help them make important decisions as well.",0,"tensor([[ 0.1135, -0.1842, -0.7173,  ..., -0.1468,  0.3590,  0.2462],

"In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has served our nation well and should be upheld for several reasons.

First, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the election results. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their popular vote share. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. Thus, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.

Second, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Posner argues, no region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This system ensures that the president represents and is accountable to the interests of various regions rather than just a specific region.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, ensuring that voters in those states have a significant say in the election. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading to more informed and engaged voters. This is crucial in our democracy, as the most thoughtful voters, who pay attention to the competing candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College balances the political power of large and small states. The allocation of electoral votes provides greater weight to large states in proportion to their population, as smaller states typically have a minimum of three electoral votes. This addresses the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the presidential election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and pressures associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections express their political preference rather than thinking that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this knowledge, approximately half of the eligible American population still chose to vote in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances the political power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is essential for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country. I look forward to seeing your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

"The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as a compromise method established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, serves to maintain the integrity of the democratic process while also ensuring fair representation for all states. While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College remains the optimal method for electing the President, as it guarantees certain essential factors that a direct election would not.

One significant advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. With the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of a disputed result or a close call, as a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in prolonged litigation and uncertainty, as seen in the 2000 presidential election crisis.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's President. Since no particular region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates must have broad trans-regional appeal. This requirement discourages candidates from solely focusing on favorable regions and enables them to represent the interests of all Americans. This prevents regional favoritism and helps maintain a cooperative balance among different regions of the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College system promotes fairness and empowers states of all sizes. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, ensuring that diverse perspectives and interests are taken into account by candidates. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated areas, deliberately neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By giving each state a voice in electing the President, the Electoral College addresses the malapportionment of the Senate and provides a more balanced representation of the country as a whole.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College inevitably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged electoral processes and ensures a more streamlined and efficient election.

While critics argue that a direct popular vote system would encourage voter participation, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are those who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will sway the election. In fact, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their state's outcome was predetermined. Therefore, the Electoral College does not impact voter turnout significantly.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democracy, providing certainty of outcome, fair representation for all states, and balance in the political process. It promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages candidates to address the concerns of all Americans, and ensures efficient and effective elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College stands as a solid method for electing our President.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College to protect the democratic principles upon which our country was founded.

After released on the JPL web site, the photo revealed a natural landform. Later in 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took another trip to Cydonia on a cloudless summer day. They snapped an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum pixel use. The picture later revealed a Martian equivalent of a butte.

"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also reffered to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar syestem, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninheritable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Farenheit is very hot and would not eb suitable by a human. In fact, all of these feaures would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interests scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment woud crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to teh deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the athor is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impreessive beause even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, cant even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many peices of statictcal evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

The system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.

"The author states that Venus may have been like Earth at one point. Venus may have evidence on the surface about what could have happened to cause it to be inhospitable. Also at some point humans are probably going to run into other challenges like Venus. These claims are some of the reasons the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

According to some scientists Venus may have been like Earth at one point. If it really was like Earth before there could be much to learn about it. We could find out what the atmosphere was like before it got too extreme. There may be evidence of life that was once on the planet. In paragraph two the suthor states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size¨ This is a reason many people believe Venus could have been even more of a twin to Earth than it is now.

On the surface there could be the evidence we need to know if there was life forms on Venus. In paragraph five it is said ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This statement makes it seem that Venus really was like Earth at one point and may have proof if we could land long something on Venus long enough to study the land.

In the future humans will continue to explore the solar system and will very likely run into a planet like Venus again. So if humans can learn how to study planets like Venus or land on them then they would have the knowledge needed for the next planet. If we have experince with planets with extreme conditions before finding another planet that also has extreme conditons we could get more information from the plant and at a lot faster rate.

In conclusion, the author makes multiple points that support their idea of wanting Venus to be studied. Venus possibly being like Earth at one point and giving us experince of planets like that are very important to the author.",0,"tensor([[-0.2628,  0.0929, -0.1436,  ..., -0.1773,  0.9934,  0.1591],

I agree that computer games have some negative effects on children, but I believe that the positive effects outweigh the negative ones.

First of all, computer games can have some negative effects on children's physical development. For example, if children spend too much time playing computer games, they may not have enough time to exercise, which can lead to weight gain and poor physical fitness. Additionally, children who play a lot of violent computer games may become more aggressive and have difficulty controlling their anger.

However, computer games can also have some positive effects on children's physical development. For example, some computer games require children to use their fine motor skills to control the game characters, which can help them develop these skills. Additionally, some computer games can help children learn about healthy eating habits and the importance of exercise.

In addition, computer games can have some negative effects on children's intellectual development. For example, children who spend too much time playing computer games may have difficulty paying attention in school and may not do well academically. Additionally, children who play a lot of violent computer games may be more likely to engage in aggressive or violent behavior.

However, computer games can also have some positive effects on children's intellectual development. For example, some computer games can help children develop problem-solving skills. Additionally, some computer games can help children learn about history, geography, and other cultures.

Finally, computer games can have some negative effects on children's psychological development. For example, children who spend too much time playing computer games may become isolated from their peers and have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships. Additionally, children who play a lot of violent computer games may become more aggressive and have difficulty controlling their anger.

However, computer games can also have some positive effects on children's psychological development. For example, some computer games can help children develop social skills. Additionally, some computer games can help children learn how to cope with frustration and failure.

In conclusion, computer games can have both positive and negative effects on children. However, I believe that the positive effects outweigh the negative ones.

"Video gaming has been an increasingly popular pastime in recent years. There are many different genres of video games and each have a unique set of characteristics that can provide endless hours of entertainment for people of all ages. One particular genre, role-playing games (RPGs), is particularly intriguing due to its immersive nature and expansive storylines. At the core, RPGs are all about character customization, progression, and exploration; players build their own characters by choosing from a variety of races and classes as well as customizing their look through cosmetic choices like clothing or armor sets. As they progress through the game world completing quests or dungeons they gain experience points which grant access to new abilities or skills that give them an edge against enemies or obstacles later on in their journey. This kind of gradual growth allows for meaningful decision-making regarding how to best equip your character at any given point with enough depth to keep even veteran players engaged over long periods of time. Furthermore, there’s usually some overarching narrative that drives the player forward throughout these countless battles; it could be anything from saving a kingdom from evil forces to just simply finding out who you really are before it's too late! It's this captivating story coupled with great soundtracks and visuals that truly pull you into these fantasy worlds RPG fans love so much - giving them a sense of escapism not found anywhere else in the world today. In addition, developers often add replay value via extra side modes such as collecting all weapons or items within a certain area while adding postgame content like bonus missions which further enhances longevity no matter what type of gamer you may be!. Ultimately RPGs offer one thing above all else: an unforgettable adventure full opportunities where everyone has something unique awaiting them just around every corner if they're brave enough take up the challenge! Whether playing solo or with friends online - RPG fans will always find something special within these virtual realms filled with danger, excitement, mysteries waiting solved.and maybe even friendships

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to advocate for its retention in the process of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that would be lost if it were abolished.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in a presidential election. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results, as observed in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to this certainty, as even a minor lead in a state can result in a significant electoral vote advantage.

Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to multiple regions and address the concerns of a diverse range of voters. This ensures that the president represents and takes into account the interests of citizens from all parts of the country, fostering national unity.

The swing state concept, facilitated by the Electoral College, is another compelling reason to retain this system. It encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states and closely engage with voters in these crucial regions. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, carefully consider their choices, and make informed decisions. This allows the most thoughtful voters to have a significant say in selecting the president.

The Electoral College also gives large states the political weight they deserve. Without the Electoral College, smaller states would have disproportionately less influence in presidential elections due to their lower populations and fewer electoral votes. The Electoral College balances this disparity and incentivizes candidates to pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This ensures a clear and decisive winner, avoiding the confusion and complications that would arise from further rounds of voting. It simplifies the presidential election process and provides a more efficient way to determine the next president.

While there are criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the argument that it discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter participation is primarily driven by the desire to express a political preference. Furthermore, addressing this concern does not necessitate the abandonment of the Electoral College, but rather calls for initiatives to encourage voter engagement and provide information about the importance of their vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system, ensuring certainty, national representation, and balanced political influence. It is not a perfect system, but the benefits it provides outweigh the disadvantages. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,"tensor([[-8.0970e-01, -1.5912e-01, -4.4415e-01,  ..., -4.6260e-01,

"It is true that college graduates earn higher salaries than those who are less well-educated in the community. This is because college graduates have a higher level of knowledge and skills that can be applied to the workplace. However, I believe that college graduates should pay the full cost of their study.

The cost of college tuition is rising every year, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for students to pay for their education. This is especially true for those who come from lower-income families. By having college graduates pay the full cost of their study, it would help to offset the cost of tuition for those who cannot afford it. This would also help to ensure that those who are most in need of a college education are able to get it.

In addition, having college graduates pay the full cost of their study would help to ensure that they are taking their education seriously. When students have to pay for their education, they are more likely to take it'seriously and put in the effort to do well. This would help to ensure that college graduates are well-prepared for the workplace and have the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful.

Finally, having college graduates pay the full cost of their study would help to ensure that the quality of education is maintained. When students are paying for their education, they are more likely to demand a higher quality of education. This would help to ensure that college graduates are well-prepared for the workplace and have the skills and knowledge necessary to be successful.

In conclusion, I believe that college graduates should pay the full cost of their study. This would help to offset the cost of tuition for those who cannot afford it, ensure that students are taking their education seriously, and help to maintain the quality of education.

"I was thinking to work at the police station because I can work on cases that could allow me to travel around the world and some cases that can be cool and super fun. It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country.

Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money.

Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely. For example, On one Sunday morning you felt sick and a strange feeling you had something missing. You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick. All day you tried to erase the fact that you didn't complete you assignment, you tried to throw that thought away, but you couldn't. You wanted to not even think about and wishing the thought could just disappear. You felt like brain was rotting for thinking too, much. You called you best friend ( that also worked at the police station:) because you wanted some company. When she entered your apartment, she saw that you weren't in the living room. She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you. Just then she started to stare at you, and you were reaching for a bucket of your favorite ice cream, strawberry. She looked at you and saw that you scooped a spoonful of ice cream and you shoved it into your mouth, with your TV on. (You were watching the Titanic with the lights off because you felt sad and had nothing to do) She went up to you and hugged you and asked what has happened to you and why you were feeling down. You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement. You went to go change and finished the assignment on time. This is why it's a good thing to be friends at work for you can't be so lonley.",0,"tensor([[-0.0235, -0.5676, -0.0190,  ..., -0.4469,  0.3788, -0.4217],

"Hands Free Law

Losing the privilege to drive can be upsetting, all the work that's put in just to get the privilege to drive. Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.

Driving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it's raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it's not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.

Another example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don't know where they're going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.

To keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not ""record or broadcast a video"" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.

Driving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.",0,"tensor([[-0.3824, -0.4593, -0.2526,  ..., -0.3182,  0.3702,  0.2548],

"imagine a world where global warming could actually be depicted as a myth, a world where you could walk out side a breath cleaner and more safer air. Limiting car usages will indeed help the environment in a major way over a estimated period of time. elisabeth Rosenthal, author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Robert Duffer, author of Paris bans driving due to smog, Andrew Selsky, author of Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and elisabethh Rosenthal, author of The End of Car Culture all have valid points when it come to explaining the great advantages of limiting car usages. Without the use of car america would indeed be a safer and move gren place to live.

To begain, cars is one major sorce of stress and pollution and without them he earth would be alittle more peaceful. The turnout was large, dispite gra clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota Selsky. The source above is just one example of how the lack out cars brought together a whole city. Walking around in the rain, something most people wouldnt do often was brought together when a city banned cars for a day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Unless you are driving a electric car, cars are not good for the environment in an way. Passenger cars ae responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal. May not seem like a big number but that 12 percent will effect the environment, causing things like global warming. Cars are needed in daily life but limiting their uses from now and then would help improve the life expectancy of our Earth.

Furthermore lowering the uses of car can also can help save the Earth we are talking about a long term outcome. Paris typicaly has more smog than other European capitals....last week Paris had 17 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter Duffer. France has high levels of smog due to their use of diesel more then gasoline. These high levels would be lowered once the use of cars are limited. The use of driving can be limited in multiple was, such as the use of internet or cell phones. Whie these devices can only give you the feeling of talking to one another, it is a very great way to reduce emmision levels. The internet makes telelcommuting possible and allows people to feel moe connected withou driving to meet friends Rosenthal.

In conclusion, a safer and more greener earth are just two advantages of limiting car usages. The Eath will also be around for your daughter and her kids to come. Their are mulitple ways andvantages of limiting car usages.",0,"tensor([[ 0.0975, -0.0458,  0.3305,  ..., -0.8229,  1.1705, -0.4432],

"Firstly, i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions, becaue it is not someting that can just be eaisily told these days and it must have been even worst to tell in the past. I personally beilieve that it wold be best to have somehing that has been woked on by many people and can be very well depended on. These days no one can tell ho someone fels because of their facial expression. so in my essay will be giving evidence that supports whymi am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions.

Secondly, my evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotionl expressions is in the text where it text states "" The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thoma Huang, of the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof . Nicu sebe of the university of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"". from this evidence i can definenly defend and give evidence for why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. from tis quote i am for the value of using tthis technology to read students emotionl expressions because their are many people many universities who combind their knowlege and what they know together so off couse they would come up with something so great. by something so graet i mean humans, technology and emotions. What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together.

Thirdly, another evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this tehnology to read students emotional expressions is in the text where the text states "" The process begin with the computer model of the face .....then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. paul eckman......for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ......"" . from this evidence i should already know that i am for this technology and i agree with it being used to read students emotional expressions. I agree with it being used to read students emotinal expression, because just from the first four words of the quote i know that is is definently dependable .I know from those four words in the begining of the quote that this passage tells me everything that i need to know about this technology. It also leaves me without worries and question but the need to use it.

Fourth, another evidence that i can use that supports why i am for this the quote ""The software is the latest innovtion from "" just from this quote i can support why i am foe the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions because i no that what ever company or what so ever this project will definently be graet and will as much as it is expected to do great. Another reason why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is the text states ""While looking at the mirror :......1....2...3...... does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

Can your lab partner recognize which one........accordig to facial feedback....."".

Also this quote "" Who ever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion! from this quote i can say that people can't just understand your emotions and how you feel because of your face expression so that is wy their is a need for a technology that is thrustfull and has been developed with so much knowlege to help with all that and the curiusity of how someone feels from their facial expression.

To conclued i would definently say that i am for the valueof using this technoogy to read sudents emotonal expressions. This technogy is the latest technology so i can count on its new developments. This techology has been created by many developers many universities, many proffesors so am for sure that they made it the best that it should and needsto be. This technology helps us understand and fills us in with all the questions that we have of it and it and the human emotion and others.

"Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other environmental effects have plagued the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. ultimately, as people begin the shift from automobile transport certain economic, environmental, and societal advantages will benefit the world we live in today.

In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of ""carfree"" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very beneficial, to the environment and daily life. For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in which they have a car free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting transportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, restaurants, and shopping districts being created.

In Paris, nearrecords pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable environmental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local environment. If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local environment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases.

The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bikesharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.

Overall, benefits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the environment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.",0,"tensor([[-0.4608, -0.2284,  0.2945,  ..., -0.4567,  0.5807, -0.1498],

"The Challenge of Exploring Venus.

Venus is one of the brightest star at night. Second planet to our sun. Human have sent many spacecraft to venus but it never landed there because spacecraft couldn't stay longer then few hours. All the mission is unmanned. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket venus. Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The National Aeronautics and space administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending human to study venus. Peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far baove the planet can provide only limited insight on gorund condition because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard form of photography and videography ineffective.

"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Evidence from Around the World

The modern world, heavily reliant on motor vehicles, is witnessing a transformation in thinking about transportation. Across the globe, from German suburbs, to Colombian capital cities and beyond, the value of reducing car usage is being recognized. These initiatives not only support environmental sustainability but also contribute to the enhancement of community life, reduction of pollution, and introduction of alternative, healthy modes of transportation.

Initiatives such as the one implemented in the Vauban district in Germany illustrate the potential advantages of limiting car usage on a large scale (Rosenthal, 2009). By implementing “smart planning” strategies such as reducing parking facilities and promoting walking, 70% of Vauban’s families have given up car ownership, leading to less pollution and a more serene community environment. This initiative has exhibited a unique treatment of suburbs, proving that life in such areas can still thrive without absolute car dependency.

While car usage reduction can be seen as an “experimental” situation in places like Vauban, its previse is being adopted worldwide to make suburbs more accessible and less car-dependent. The US Environmental Protection Agency promotes “car-reduced” communities, aiming to balance out the majority of appropriations given to highways in transportation bills (Rosenthal, 2009). If realized, such changes could significantly decrease the US’s greenhouse gas emissions, which count transportation as the second largest source (Rosenthal, 2013).

A direct effect of limiting vehicle use can be witnessed in cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban lifted smog rivalling that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities globally (Duffer, 2014). This drastic measure, repeated on different days according to the car's license plate number, illustrates the immediate results that car-reduction strategies can offer in enhancing air quality.

Bogota, the capital of Colombia, offers a yearly car-free day where citizens exclusively use alternative modes of transportation, boosting public spirit and drastically reducing pollution in the process (Selsky, 2002). This not only promotes alternative means of commuting but also revitalizes the city with an air of communal cooperation. This strategy has even sparked interest in other city authorities from around the world, who may adopt the event in their cities.

Finally, the United States also appears to be experiencing a cultural shift toward limiting car usage by seeing fewer car purchases, less driving, and a decrease in issued licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if perpetuated, could contribute substantially to achieving environmental sustainability goals. In acknowledgment of this shift, car companies are expanding their product ranges and beginning to label themselves as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across varied global contexts. From air pollution reduction to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and the revamp of community life, these initiatives present compelling reasons for further exploration and consideration for adoption by other cities and nations globally. As awareness grows, the possibility of even greater collaborative steps towards a world with less car-dependent economies seems increasingly attainable.",1,"tensor([[-0.4716, -0.2766, -0.3697,  ..., -0.1624,  0.1628, -0.0570],

"The famous artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelo's quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation.

To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth.

Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality.

When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal.

Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain.

However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak.

However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so.

In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement. ",0,"tensor([[-0.0060, -0.2177, -0.2802,  ..., -0.1781,  0.4191,  0.2770],

"How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures. People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.

Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4. This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well.

In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus. He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6. The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more.

Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. It affects how we perceive and interpret the world around us, and can significantly influence the paths we choose to take. Those with a positive outlook perceive challenges as opportunities and are never negatively influenced by setbacks. They are able to approach tasks with confidence, and are more likely to achieve their goals.

Having a positive attitude has its benefits not only in the workplace, but in other aspects of life. A positive attitude can lead to better relationships with family and friends since it can reduce anxiety and create better feelings of wellbeing. It can also lead to better physical health, as a positive outlook can reduce stress levels, improve immunity, and be protective against depression and anxiety.

Those who possess a positive attitude often find more success in their career and personal lives. They are seen as reliable people who can be trusted to get the job done. Their enthusiasm and optimistic outlook allow them to think positively when faced with challenges and difficult tasks. They are also able to motivate others to take on difficult tasks, and are often successful in team environments.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life. It can have a profound impact on how we perceive the world, and can lead to greater emotional, social, and physical wellbeing. Those who possess a positive attitude are more likely to find success in their personal and professional spheres, and are seen as reliable and trustworthy people.",1,"tensor([[-0.0546, -0.2730, -0.5856,  ..., -0.5174, -0.0583,  0.2857],

"Cars are very important to the life of a modern person. The car gets you where you need to go in the time that you want to go in. There are ways to limit car usage and still get your transportation to where you need to go. There are some advantages to not using cars all the time. One advantage is that if we stop using cars, then pollution will drop drastically. Another advantage to us not using cars is that we get plenty of excercise while we do other things than just sit in our cars.

Paris, France. Known for being the city of love, but doesn't have a certain love for cars. They banned car usage after days of near-record pollution(source 2 paragraph 10). In order to make sure that the residents don't use their cars still the placed a 22-euro fine ($31) for anyone still driving(source 2 paragraph 11). After only just  a few days, congestion was down almost 60 percent in the capital of France( source 2 paragraph 14). In the United States, most kids these days aren't driving as much as they used to. They are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year( source 4 paragraph 29). If this keeps up, then alot of sociologist think that this will have a huge effect on the environmet, which will lead to the end of pollution problems(source 4 paragraph 34). This advantage of having less car usage will not only help the earth, but it also will help the things on the earth including us humans and animals.

The final advantage that limiting car usage is that we will have plenty of excercise. A mother of two that had a car but the sold it in Germany said "" When i had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way""(source 1 paragraph 3). She usually walks down the street to and from wherever she goes. Excercising is great for your health and you can just start by walking, biking, skating, roller blading and many more ways to get to where you need to go. In Bogota, Columbia millions of people hiked , biked, skated, or took buses to work (source 3 paragraph 20). ""It's good oppurtunity to take away stress..."" (source 3 paragraph 24) said businessman Carlos Artura Plaze when he was asked about the banning of cars for the third straight year in Germany( source 3 paragraph 24). Stress isn't good for your health and excercising is great on removing that stress from your body. Excersisng is a great advantage to limited car usage because you reduce stress, work out, and feel better all while you get to where you need to go at the same time.

The advantages that everyone gets from limited car usage is that the pollution will go down, and you get better excercise. If pollution goes down then you will have a better earth for everyone to enjoy, but you can't enjoy the earth if it's congested with polutted air. You also get great excercise when you walk, bike, skate to wherever you need to go instead of sitting in a car to go to your destination. These are only some of the advantages that you get when you choose to limit your car usage, but there are plenty more that you will experience as soon as you limit the usage of cars.",0,"tensor([[-8.7247e-02, -4.3903e-01, -1.1850e-02,  ..., -2.8782e-01,

"The landform on Mars that looks like a face may seem like a momument created by aliens to some people, but it is actually just a mesa, which was uncovered by NASA's cameras on a cloudy day. An ancient alien civilization seems more than possible to some, but while it is a possibility, the landform on Mars is not an ancient civilization. Evidence of this is found on the image directly before the article, which shows the landform over time. More recent cameras have a better quality of capturing photos than previous ones, which is why NASA photographed the landform at different years. The landform on Mars is just a mesa, because it resembles natural rock formations on Earth and there is photo proof of it.

The face on Mars is just a mesa, because according to the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa -- landforms common around the American West."" The article later states that the Martian landform resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho, which is a lava dome. The Martian landform is clearly a natural mesa, not an ancient civilization created by aliens, since it resembles occurances that are common in Earth's natural structure.

The Martian landform is a natural occuring rock formation, since there is photo proof of it and it looks identical to mesas, buttles, and lava domes on Earth.

"Most young people believe that they enjoy life more than older people do. They think that older people are stuck in their ways, set in their ways, and don’t know how to have fun. However, this is not always the case. While it is true that older people may not be as flexible as younger people, they often have more wisdom and life experience. This can lead to a more fulfilling life.

One reason why older people may enjoy life more is because they are often more wise. They have lived longer and have made more mistakes. As a result, they know what to do and what not to do in many situations. They can also offer advice to younger people. This wisdom can be very helpful in making life more enjoyable.

Another reason why older people may enjoy life more is because they are often more settled. They may have a family and a home. They may also have a job that they like. This can lead to a life that is more stable and predictable. This can be very reassuring for older people. It can also make life more enjoyable because they don’t have to worry about the future as much.

Of course, there are also some drawbacks to being older. One is that older people may not be as flexible as younger people. They may not be able to do some of the things that they used to do. For example, they may not be able to travel as much. They may also not be able to work as many hours. Another drawback is that older people may have more health problems. This can make life more difficult.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to being older. However, there are also many advantages. Older people often have more wisdom and life experience. This can lead to a more enjoyable life.

"Whether we have our license or not, we can all relate to the stress of the daily commute. As of the past century, cars have been one of the most efficient ways to get from point A to point B. Now, mainly due to air pollution, there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of cars used for travel. The advantages of limiting car usage include less stress, less air pollution, and an overall improved society.

The stress of traffic and the constant pressure to be on time would be significantly reduced if people chose other means of transportation such as riding a bike, taking public transportation such as the subway or bus, or walking. Source 1 shows just how effective decreased car usage can be. It describes Vauban, Germany, a small suburb community in which there is virtually no car usage. Many citizens report being less tense, as everything is made within means of walking distance.

Another cause of stress from car usage is the effects it has on the atmosphere. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.Source 1 Paris is an excellent example of just how much car usage has had such negative effects on the atmosphere. Source 2 explains how Paris was so smog ridden it rivaled Bejing, China. Paris then placed limits on car usage until the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted.

Not only does decreased car usage help the planet, it helps society as a whole. Source 3 describes Bogota, Columbia and how it celebrates one day a year of no car usage. The city has found that not only has this policy helped clear the smog, but it is enthusiastically endorsed by the citizens. Most people turned out to see the bike races, despite the occasional rain showers. This has caused two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar to join the event. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 bike paths, the most of any Latin American city. It is not just the government endorsing decreased car usage but people themselves. Source 4 points out how the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below the peak. There are various explanation for why people are driving less, one might be that the internet makes increased telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without having to drive to them.

It is evident that we are witnessing a major cultural shift, possible degressing, but in the best possible way. The decreased incline to drive has resulted in less air pollution, a less stressed population, and an improved society overall.",0,"tensor([[-0.3658, -0.6420,  0.2372,  ..., -0.1740,  0.7278, -0.3165],

"Recently, in many countries around the world, there have been actions made towards the reduction or complete banishment of most automobiles in order to help advance society. In Paris, there was a law enacted forcing drivers to leave their cars at home every other day. A majority of the reasoning behind such a ban was the pollution that were constantly emitted into the atmosphere. This is not only accepted by the general public, but some even say that their stress was much lower than with automobiles in daily life.

The people who give up their vehicles to live in Vauban, Germany report having less stress than when they did use cars as daily transportation. As stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer who lives in Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In this experimental suburban community, places to park a car are forbidden in most areas. They go as far as to rid of all driveways and parking lots in the community. This creates more spaces or businesses to operate, causing all stores to be built closer to households. This in turn makes getting to and from places faster and safer. The people in Paris also prefer the decreased amount of vehicles during rush hour, which alleviates their stress tremendously when navigating the city. This has affected less major cities also, such as Bogota. Their annual carfree day has lead to the construction of over 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the longest amount in any Latin country. Not only that, but other recreational activity centers have also emerged throughout the city, according the mayor of Bogota.

Pollution has had a large impact in large, carintensified cities like Paris, which was, at some points, comparable to places with the most pollution. The smog eventually resided, but some aspects of the ban still remained. The cars there typically use diesel over gasoline due to tax policies that prefer it specifically. Thus, about two thirds of the vehicles in France prefer diesel engines, which are to blame for the smog that engulfed Paris. According the New York Times, Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for twelve percent of the total greenhouse emissions. The percentage in the United States is over four times that in some congested areas.

The cities of Paris, Vauban, and Bogota are few of the many global areas that have taken on the challenge of removing cars from their daily lives, which has benefited both their health and their environment. This is a part of the longterm shift in our societies' way of commuting from one place to another. The amount of people going to get driver licesnses has been on a decline since 2005 in the United States, and is projected the continue that path for a long time. In fact, there was a twenty three percent decrease in young poeple driving form 2001 to 2009. People are alreading seeing the benefits of decreasing the use of cars, and the amount of traffic is only going to keep decreasing.

"Phones and driving

Lots of people always argue about being able to have their phones while driving, but that shouldn't be debatable. Not only do you put your life in risk, but you put other peoples life in risk. So many car accidents are caused because of texting and driving, most these accidents involved by teens. You should not be using your phone while you drive. Doing that puts everyone around you in danger. So is one text really worth it, is it worth putting your life in danger and others. It is extremely dangerous, because once you are on your phone you can't take your eyes off your phone.

Everyday in the United States Of America around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and those drivers are distracted by their phone, causing them to lose control of the vehicle, putting people at risk of losing their lives. Texting and driving has been the biggest districation in the world. Every year, 21% of fatal car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were the result of using their cell phone while behind the wheel. This will increase 4% every year, and will be the resulting in more car accidents. No only do teenagers text and drive, but one fifth of an adult in the united states has been texting in driving.

Some people believe just because they are good drivers and it's just one text, nothing bad can happen but that is completely wrong. One text can change your entire life. It does not matter if you are a great driver like you may think, no one is a good driver. If another person who is being distracted by using their phone, they are not being a careful driver, in a flash of your eyes, you are putting your own life in danger because of the actions you are choosing to follow, which also puts the people around you in danger.

Some people argue that if they take their eyes off the road to look at their phone. No harm is being done to anyone, but so many things can happen in that one second for example a car can break and by the time the driver looks up it might be too late. There has been so many terrible car accidents, have killed kids, a mother, a father, a love one, and sometimes an entire family. When you get into a car accident and the cause of the accident was because you were distracted by your phone and you end up killing someone or causing them to go to the hospital the driver can end up in jail, because you shouldn't be on your phone when you are driving, If something is important and you need to be on your phone, you should pull over or park somewhere and then continue to drive, but you should never text in drive to put people's life in danger.

In conclusion, driving while texting should not be debatable because it is the most dangerous thing in the U.S. and its increasing and increasing every year and every day. That being teens of age 16 get in the most car accidents. There should be a law to prevent this, no one should lose a loved one because of a car accident involving the driver being distracted, because there could've been so many things done to prevent that. Losing control of a vehicle is so easy and dangerous when you get distracted by your phone. All accidents involving a driver being on their phone is totally preventable when you just leave it alone.",0,"tensor([[ 0.2909, -0.2852,  0.0147,  ..., -0.3860,  0.5448, -0.0401],

"Many students and teachers think that taking online classes are bad for the students and the school. The reason is that the students might not take any notes on what the teacher is saying. The other reason is that students will often get distracted from the lecture the teacher is giving to them. Students cannot be benefited of taking online classes because students might not take notes and that the students might not pay attention to the teacher.

Students might not take notes while being on a class that is online. For example, at school, students take notes because they are being watched by the teacher, so why would they do it if they are not being watched by the teacher; the students would not care about the notes. If the teacher is on the screen, but cannot see if the student is taking notes; most likely there are not because the students won't worry that the teacher could check them. Students should take notes when they get information about a topic, so that topic could stay in the mind of the student if they write it and they also try understand the topic from the notes. Teacher's won't even know there students are taking notes because it's online they cannot see them. also the students might not be paying attention.

The students might not pay any attention to the lecture the teacher is giving to them. For example, when a student looks around the classroom, but not at the teacher, they will miss valuable information that is needed, so it's like the same when it comes to online classes; information will be missed by the students. Missing information when distracted is terrible because students might miss out on what is going on in the class, might miss on something on they have to do, and miss on how to do there work. Students should pay attention; no one likes to miss any key information; therefore, students need to look at the teacher to get more information as needed to do an assignment. When students don't take notes, they will not only miss out on some key information, but might panic on how to do a problem on the assignment they were given.

The students cannot benefit from taking online classes because the students might not write valuable information in there notes and they might not pay attention to lecture that teacher is giving to them. The students won't take any notes because no one is watching them take the notes as the teacher goes on lecturing. The students could miss valuable information because they are not paying attention to the teacher, and the students might miss on how to do something in a assignment. From not taking notes to note paying attention is the reason why there cannot be students taking online classes because teachers might not know what the students are doing and students might not even care about all of this.",0,"tensor([[-0.0717, -0.2076, -0.3311,  ..., -0.3874,  0.3887,  0.3058],

"Unmasking the Face on Mars

""Come over here quick!"" As I told my NASA crew members, I told them that I had found something. Hi i'm a scientist at NASA diccusing the face that another scientist thinks it was created by aliens. As i told them they all came and was wondering what I needed them for and if I found clues. ""I think I found parts of the face that is not an aliens."" states one of the scientist at NASA. We didn't find anything unusual, except that there may be more than one of the faces.

Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.

April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos. Many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image to appear on their screens. All they got was a natural landform no sign of alien transformation.

Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. The caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation. Which is resembles a human head. It is formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose and mouth. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way t engage and attract the public attentions to Mars.

What the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent if a mesa or a landform. Which was common around the AMerican West. It reminds many people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idoho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same size as the face on Mars.",0,"tensor([[-0.5847, -0.2952,  0.4746,  ..., -0.0554,  0.9258,  0.0879],

"I bet your wondering what a Electoral college is in your head ,

well an Electoral college is not somewhere you go to like a regular college but its a process ,

they established it in constitution as a compromise.

Its where they vote for presidents and vice president including the electoral votes by congress ,

Electoral college consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president .

To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .

After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,

the fun part is that most states gets a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,

also your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""

listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .

This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.

Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .

For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign

Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes .

But hopefully you learned about the Electoral College and what it really is  ,and what the electors have to go through to be president.",0,"tensor([[-0.1792, -0.3324,  0.4510,  ..., -0.6205,  1.0524,  0.7718],

"Drivers should be able to use phones while driving. Even though texting while driving is against the law people have invented apps and devices that allows you to use the phone without actually holding the phone in your hand they have phone holders and aux cables.

Even if your not allowed to hold your phone while driving to change the music or change the call you can now use an aux or voice activated command like siri or alexa. Which would make it safer to use your phone while driving and not having to your phone

Most people nowadays still drive while texting on the phone I know my older brother and my God dad do it all the time. I sometimes wonder if im supposed to say something about them driving while on the phone.

Using phones while in the car can be a good thing in the since that in case of emergency and you aren't able to reach your phone with your hand you can use voice activation to call the police or fire department.

"I agree that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be a better choice than to continue Electoral College. You may ask yourself why. Well, it's not fair to have to pick a random person to do something you should be the one doing. It's like saying you pick your neighbor to clean your house. Your house is still being cleaned, but not by you, instead, a random person you don't even know. Thus, continuing Electoral College is the same because in this case, the elector you pick and don't even know is going to make choices that at the end of the day you might not even agree on and you can't do nothing about it at that point.

During electoral College voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This means, there is too many names on the list that you most likely have never even heard in your life, therefore leading you to voting for the wrong candidate. Some electors aren't even faithful, instead of going for their party's candidate, they rather decide voting for whomever they please. Most likely leading to alot of conflict because the candidate is not even on their party and the voters would hate to have to follow someone else's rules, yet again, can't do nothing about it.

Voters would always love to control whom their electors vote for, but this will never happen with Electoral College. The whole point to me for the Electoral College is so that the people voting for the electors won't have any power against anything. So that the government continues to have power over the people. That can be great at some point, but sooner or later will cause confict because some people don't always agree with what the government has to say or do. Therefore, changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S would be much better than to continue Electoral College.

On the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong "". States that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now right there is a perfect example of electors being ""unfair"". Electors want people to keep voting for them so that they can pick the candidates, yet, they always skip the part of showing who the candidates are. There is no why people will randomly guess how their candidates will end up being if they never even hear a few words from them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S is a wiser decision than to continue Electoral College because it'll be fair to the people who are voting. People will start to get together to try and get to know the candidate, and most likely agree more to the idea than anything else. Mean while, Electoral College is a very unfair system because they have no idea who the elector is going to pick as candidate, and if they pick someone who they don't even know at the end of the day they will be stuck with a total stranger.",0,"tensor([[-0.4327, -0.2553, -0.5918,  ..., -0.3500,  0.4872,  0.4533],

"When one thinks of the word success, many definitions come to mind. For some, it may mean achieving a high level in school or at work while for others it may require having financial security or finding lasting love. However, success is often more complicated than that; real success requires self-reflection and an understanding of our own personal values. In order to achieve true and lasting success, we must first identify what those values are, which is no easy task as they can be ever-changing and sometimes hard to define. One way of identifying our personal values is by reflecting on past experiences both good and bad - whether that’s from childhood memories where we learned positive habits from role models or lessons from mistakes made during adulthood. Once these reflections have been made we can start to pinpoint the things that matter most: qualities like integrity, loyalty, honesty and trustworthiness. Such traits will become the building blocks for achieving long-term successes in life; if any part of our lives lacks these characteristics then there won't be true balance in our overall accomplishments. Having identified key values within ourselves it's time to think about how best to use them towards successful outcomes; this means not only aiming for tangible wins such as getting into college/university but also pursuing intangible triumphs like developing relationships with family members and friends who support us through thick-and-thin moments that build strong characters over time. It also involves taking risks when opportunities arise even though there might be fear associated with them – such bravery pays off eventually! Finally staying motivated throughout every step of the process serves as great fuel for reaching a desired goal since it helps maintain focus along the journey towards success rather than giving up before anything has been achieved . . To sum up – being successful isn't just about attaining material wealth or academic achievements; its instead something deeper rooted within ourselves based on individual core values which come together after careful reflection over meaningful experiences had throughout life so far.
